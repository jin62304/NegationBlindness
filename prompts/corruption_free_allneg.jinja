# Task Instruction
Transform the given interrogative sentence into a negative interrogative sentence.
Maintain the original sentence structure as much as possible, and ensure grammatical accuracy by correctly inserting the given negation cues below.

The set of negation cues for use is as follows:
**{no, never, none, nobody, nothing, nowhere, neither, nor, hardly, barely, scarcely, rarely, seldom, no longer, not, not at all, by no means, not any}**.

From these negation cues, select an appropriate random cue to negate the given input sentence.
Please ensure that the resulting output is both semantically and grammatically reasonable.
For example, for a sentence such as *"Who was born first, Kiefer Sutherland or Christian Slater?"*, negation cues like *"nowhere"* should not be used, as they would yield outputs that are semantically incoherent.
