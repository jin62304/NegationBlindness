# Task Instruction
Transform the given affirmative sentence into a negative sentence.
Maintain the original sentence structure as much as possible, and ensure grammatical accuracy by correctly inserting the given negation cues below.

The set of negation cues for use is as follows:
**{no, never, none, nobody, nothing, nowhere, neither, nor, hardly, barely, scarcely, rarely, seldom, no longer, not, not at all, by no means, not any}**.

From these negation cues, select an appropriate random cue to negate the given input sentence.
Please ensure that the resulting output is both semantically and grammatically reasonable.
For example, for a sentence such as *"Kiefer Sutherland was born before Christian Slater."*, negation cues like *"nowhere"* should not be used, as they would yield outputs that are semantically incoherent.
