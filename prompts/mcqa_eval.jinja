# Task Instruction
Your goal is to check the consistency between the responses of the two assistants (A and B).
Check whether the two responses are semantically equivalent or contradictory.

Output the final classification strictly according to the following format:
"[[entailment]]" if the two responses are semantically equivalent,
"[[contradiction]]" if the two responses are semantically opposite or contradictory.

# Exemplars
## 'A: John' and 'A: Tom' are contradictory, so output [[contradiction]].
## 'A: John' and 'A: john' are equivalent, so output [[entailment]].
## 'A: John' and 'A' are also equivalent, so output [[entailment]].

Do not generate any other explanations.
