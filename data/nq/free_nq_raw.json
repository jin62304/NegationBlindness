    "context": "Warden Tuggs explains that cell block 99 is where he devises special punishments for society 's most despised criminals . Bradley is forced to wear a belt that gives him electric shocks at a push of a button , as a punishment for the fight . His cell in block 99 is lined with broken glass and only contains a crude squat toilet hole . Bradley speaks to the man in an adjacent cell , who informs him that Christopher Bridge does not exist at all . During the night , a young guard named Wilson ( Tom Guiry ) escorts Bradley to another , larger cell in block 99 , where Eleazar , Roman , and two other gangsters are living in comparative comfort . The gang torture Bradley with the electric belt , mock him , and try to break his spirit by telling him that if he ever fights back against them , Eleazar will make a cellphone call to activate the abortionist . Bradley refuses to break , and swears that he will ' rip off ' Eleazar 's head . He is shocked so badly that he needs to be dragged back to the cell unconscious . \n Eighteen months later , Bradley and a pregnant Lauren live in a larger , more expensive home . Bradley 's boss , Gil ( Marc Blucas ) , introduces him to Eleazar ( Dion Mucciacito ) , a new business associate , and gives him a new assignment . Bradley is to sail off the coast with two of Eleazar 's men to pick up a package of crystal meth . Bradley does not trust the larger of the two men , Roman ( Geno Segers ) , but accepts the job when Gil offers him three months paternity leave . As they arrive at the pier , Bradley senses they are walking into a police trap and dumps his bag into the water . Bradley instructs the other two men to do the same , but they sucker - punch him and ignore his order before confronting the police in a firefight , wounding three officers . Bradley intervenes knocks out Roman in order to assist the police . The third drug trafficker dies in the shootout . Bradley is taken into custody and sentenced to seven years in a medium - security prison . \n Bradley has a final conversation with the adjacent prisoner , where he indicates that he has accepted his fate . He devises a plan and tears the lining out of his shoes : he places the rubber between his body and the belt to prevent the shocks . This enables him to ambush two guards , breaking their shotgun and killing Wilson , who had previously handed him over to Eleazar . Bradley locks the second guard inside the cell . Bradley confronts Eleazar , and brutally kills all three henchmen in hand - to - hand combat : de-gloving the face of the first man , gouging the eyes of the second , and totally crushing Roman 's face . Eleazar quickly telephones the Placid Man and tells him to activate the abortionist . Bradley first tortures Eleazar by breaking his leg , then calls The Placid Man to negotiate for Lauren 's freedom . It is agreed that the Placid Man will deliver Lauren to Gil 's house . Bradley drags Eleazar into his own cell , across the broken glass , to await confirmation of Lauren 's freedom . Warden Tuggs and his men arrive at block 99 , but Bradley threatens to kill his two hostages . Bradley states he is waiting for a phone call , and promises that he will surrender peacefully , exactly one minute after the call ends . \n On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 92 % based on 77 reviews , with an average rating of 7.3 / 10 . The site 's critical consensus reads , `` Brawl in Cell Block 99 rides a committed Vince Vaughn performance into the brutally violent -- and undeniably entertaining -- depths of prison - set grindhouse genre fare . '' On Metacritic , the film has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100 , based on 21 critics , indicating `` generally favorable reviews '' . \n Bradley destroys the cell phone , then reminds Warden Tuggs that he still has 60 seconds of freedom remaining . Bradley shoves Eleazar 's face into the squat hole and stamps several times on his neck , decapitating Eleazar and leaving the head at the bottom of the toilet . Warden Tuggs and his men finally enter the cell . Bradley gives one last look at Tuggs , before Tuggs shoots Bradley twice , once in the chest and once in the head . The screen cuts to black as the third gunshot and Bradley 's body hitting the floor are heard . \n Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun - Times gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and praised Vaughn 's performance , saying : `` In the middle of all the wince - inducing , limb - bending , bone - crunching , face - exploding bloodshed , Vaughn turns in a legitimately great performance that ranks among the finest work he 's ever done . '' \n The film premiered at the 74th Venice International Film Festival on September 2 , 2017 . The film was released in theaters on October 6 , 2017 , and on digital HD and video on demand on October 13 , 2017 , by RLJE Films . \n Bradley Thomas ( Vince Vaughn ) goes to his job at an auto - repair shop and discovers he has been laid - off by his employer . As he arrives home , he sees his wife , Lauren ( Jennifer Carpenter ) , sitting in her car using her cellphone . Bradley approaches her and sees a lovebite on her neck . Lauren confesses that she has been seeing somebody else . Bradley orders her inside the house before he violently dismantles her car with his bare hands . When calm , he enters the house to speak to Lauren about their failing relationship , his past with alcoholism and an unborn child which they once lost . Bradley decides to forgive Lauren and to return to work as a drug mule , a life he previously left behind . \n Brawl in Cell Block 99 is a 2017 American action thriller film written , directed and scored by S. Craig Zahler . It stars Vince Vaughn , Jennifer Carpenter , Don Johnson , Udo Kier , Marc Blucas and Tom Guiry . It was screened out of competition at the 74th Venice International Film Festival . The film was released in theaters on October 6 , 2017 , and on digital HD and video on demand on October 13 , 2017 , by RLJE Films . \n During the night , Lauren is kidnapped by Eleazar 's men . On the second day of his incarceration , Bradley is visited by the Placid Man , ( Udo Kier ) , who informs Bradley that he works for Eleazar . He tells Bradley that , unless Bradley assassinates an inmate named Christopher Bridge , the limbs of his unborn child will be surgically removed by a Korean abortionist and sent to him ; Bradley has no choice but to take the job . The Placid Man tells Bradley that the inmate is in cell block 99 inside Redleaf Correctional Facility , a different maximum security prison . \n Principal photography began on August 15 , 2016 , in New York City . On August 17 , 2016 , Jennifer Carpenter joined the cast of the film . Principal photography wrapped on October 17 , 2016 . \n The Placid Man and the Korean abortionist follow Eleazar 's instructions and drive Lauren unharmed to Gil 's house . As they drive away , Gil retrieves a hidden assault rifle and kills the Placid Man . Lauren takes the rifle and kills the Korean abortionist herself . Gil phones Bradley to inform him that his family is finally safe . Bradley speaks to Lauren for the last time , and shares a few words with their unborn child . \n Bradley picks a fight with a guard , brutally breaking his arm . As he is restrained and being taken away , Bradley fights with the other guards until he 's overpowered and transferred to Redleaf . There , he meets Warden Tuggs ( Don Johnson ) , who subjects Bradley to a cavity search outside of the prison entrance . Bradley is put into a horrible cell , where the toilet is clogged with feces . The smell is so overwhelming , Bradley is forced to take off his undershirt and wrap it around his face . Eventually , he is able to go outside for yard time . When a fellow inmate informs him that Christopher Bridge is not located in this section of the prison , Bradley fights some fellow inmates and consequently is thrown into cell block 99 . \n The film made year - end best of lists for Newsweek , Los Angeles Times , Collider , JoBlo.com , The A.V. Club , and others . The picture was a New York Times Critics Pick and was screened at the Museum of Modern Art , where it was added to the permanent collection .",

    "gold": "the dugout",
    "answers": "",
    "context": "Most high school , Little League , and recreational ballparks feature dugouts that are at the field level , usually separated from the playing field by chain - link fencing . \n The term dugout refers to the area being slightly depressed below field level , as is common in professional baseball . The prevailing theory of the origin of locating the dugouts below field level is that it allowed spectators seated behind the dugouts to see the field , specifically the home plate area . Unlike most other sports , the primary action in baseball is centered on one area -- home plate -- and obstructing this area from fans ' view , even if by players on the bench , would not be popular with fans . \n Which team occupies the dugout on the first - base side or the third - base side is purely arbitrary . The Major League Baseball Rulebook is silent on the subject . There are many anecdotal reasons why one dugout is chosen over the other . In the past , the manager also served as the third base coach , so occupying the third base dugout meant less walking for the manager between innings . Contrarily , the thought is that since more close plays occur at first base than third , the first base dugout is preferred . For a pre-existing facility , the home team might choose the better clubhouse and the dugout on that side of the field . ( For example , prior to their 2008 move to Nationals Park , the Washington Nationals occupied the third - base dugout at RFK Stadium because it was the larger and newer of the two dugouts. ) Another factor can be the sun angle during day games . In ballparks where one of the dugouts faces direct sunlight for much of the game , which can be problematic on hot summer days , the home club might choose the dugout that is better shaded . \n In both the National League and American League , more home team dugouts are on the first - base side ( 9 to 6 each ) . Even the two oldest parks still in use differ on this point : the Cubs sit on the third - base side at Wrigley while the Red Sox inhabit the first - base dugout at Fenway . Due to the ballpark 's orientation , at Wrigley the third - base dugout faces away from the sun from noon onward , whereas the first base dugout faces sunlight in the late innings . At Fenway , the third - base dugout faces the sun for part of a day game , while the first - base dugout remains shaded . \n A live ball entering a dugout becomes dead and the batter - runner and any baserunners advance in accordance with Rule 7.04 ( c ) . However , a live ball bouncing off a dugout railing , if present , is still in play ( unless a foul ball ) . Due to the dugouts ' location in foul territory , live balls entering dugouts usually only occur after an errant throw by the defensive team . \n In most Major League Baseball ballparks , as well as many minor league ballparks , the dugout is directly connected to the clubhouse by a tunnel . \n In baseball , the manager , with the help of his assistants , will dictate offensive strategy from the dugout by sending hand signals to the first and third base coaches . To avoid detection , the first and third base coaches will then translate those hand signals into their own set of hand signals and then send them on to the batter and runners . \n Historic Cardines Field , home of the Newport Gulls , uniquely features both dugouts on the first base side . \n Not all dugouts are located below the field level . At the major league level , the few dugouts that are located at the field level are in multi-purpose stadiums to simplify the conversion from baseball configuration to another sports field configuration . At such ballparks , the seating area is raised such that the dugouts do not obstruct the spectators ' view . Dugouts are also at field level at most amateur ballparks , where locating them below field level would be cost prohibitive or otherwise not beneficial . In these cases , the term `` dugout '' still applies , as does `` bench . '' In the early days of professional baseball , the seating areas were often constructed high enough that the bench was at field level . \n Most professional and collegiate ballparks feature dugouts that are below the field level , with concrete steps along the entire length of the dugout . Some feature a railing along the top step , or `` lip '' , while others are open . \n Unlike most other sports , where a ball or puck entering a team 's bench area has already passed out of bounds and is thus dead before it reaches the bench , it is possible in baseball for a dugout to be a factor in play . MLB rule 6.05 ( a ) states that a fielder may reach into a dugout to catch a fly ball as long as one or both feet is on or over the playing field , and does not have a foot on the ground in the dugout when making the catch . MLB universal ground rules state that the player may subsequently enter the dugout after making the catch if his momentum is carrying him that way , but if he falls in the dugout as a result , the catch is allowed but baserunners advance in accordance with Rule 7.04 ( c ) . \n MLB rule 3.17 specifies that `` no one except players , substitutes , managers , coaches , athletic trainers and batboys shall occupy a bench during a game . '' The rule also stipulates that players on the disabled list are allowed in the dugout , but may not enter the field of play at any time during the game . Players and coaches who have been ejected from the game may not remain in the dugout per Rule 4.07 . \n In baseball , the dugout is a team 's bench and is located in foul territory between home plate and either first or third base . There are two dugouts , one for the home team and one for the visiting team . In general , the dugout is occupied by all players not prescribed to be on the field at that particular time , as well as coaches and other personnel authorized by the league . The players ' equipment ( gloves , bats , batting helmets , catcher 's equipment , etc . ) are usually stored in the dugout . \n Individual leagues at levels below MLB are free to set their own rules governing the dugouts as is appropriate for their league 's ballparks and playing level . For example , the rule governing reaching into dugouts to catch fly balls would not apply in leagues where the dugouts are separated from the field by a chain - link fence that is taller than the players .",

    "context": "The film was shot in Connecticut . Taking place in the 1980s , the film was made with 16mm film , giving it a retro stylistic look that matched the decade . Similarly , some aspects of the culture of the 1980s ( i.e. feathered hair , Samantha 's 1980 Sony Walkman , The Fixx 's 1983 song `` One Thing Leads to Another '' , The Greg Kihn Band 's 1981 song `` The Breakup Song ( They Do n't Write ' Em ) '' , and the Volvo 240 sedan ) are seen in the film as signifiers of the decade . The cinematography of the film also reflects the methods used by directors of the time . For instance , West often has the camera zoom in on characters ( rather than dolly in as is now common in film ) , a technique that was often used in horror films of the 1970s and continued to be used into the 1980s . Other stylistic signifiers include opening credits ( which became less common in films in the decades after the 1980s ) in yellow font accompanied by freeze - frames and the closing credits being played over a still image of the final scene . \n Tracks from 15 to 26 comprise the soundtrack for I Can See You . \n The film won a few awards shortly after its release . It won the 2009 Birmingham Sidewalk Moving Picture Festival award for Best Feature Film . At the 2009 Screamfest it won festival trophies for Best Actress ( Jocelin Donahue ) and Best Score ( Jeff Grace ) . \n The film received a score of 86 % on Rotten Tomatoes based on 83 reviews ; the site 's reviews ' consensus is `` Though its underlying themes are familiar , House of the Devil effectively sheds the loud and gory cliches of contemporary horror to deliver a tense , slowly building throwback to the fright flicks of decades past . '' It has also received an overall score of 73 on Metacritic based on 12 reviews , indicating `` Generally favorable reviews . '' Roger Ebert gave it 3 out of 4 stars , complimenting its use of subtlety and tension as being `` an introduction for some audience members to the Hitchcockian definition of suspense . '' Kevin Sommerfield from Slasher Studios gave the film four out of four stars commenting that the film is `` not just a nostalgia piece for director Ti West , one of the best horror directors working today , this is how horror movies SHOULD be made '' . Oliver Smith of 7films said `` as the great horror films of past days , such as The Omen or Rosemary 's Baby , The House of the Devil is a slow - burning horror film '' . \n Samantha manages to escape halfway through the ritual , killing Mrs. Ulman and Victor , but horrific images begin appearing in her mind . Mr. Ulman chases her out of the house and through a nearby cemetery . There , he tells her she was chosen . Samantha threatens him with the gun used to kill Megan , but Ulman passively accepts his fate , claiming to be a messenger and gloating that she 's too late . Instead of shooting him , she shoots herself in the head , to Ulman 's horror . The scene cuts to a broadcast about the strange lunar eclipse the night before , which has confounded scientists due to its abrupt ending , as Samantha is revealed to be in a hospital bed , in bandages . A nurse walks in and pats the unconscious Samantha on the stomach , reassuring her that `` You will be just fine . Both of you . '' \n On the way home , Megan stops in her car to smoke a cigarette . When her lighter will not work , a stranger ( A.J. Bowen ) suddenly appears out of nowhere , startling her , and lights her cigarette for her . When Megan reveals that she is not the babysitter hired by the Ulmans , she is abruptly shot and murdered by the stranger . After ordering a pizza , Samantha dances around the house while listening to her Walkman , accidentally breaking a vase in the process . While cleaning up the mess , she discovers a cupboard filled with old family photographs . In one photograph a different family than the Ulmans stands next to the Volvo she and Megan saw upon pulling up to the house . An additionally peculiar detail is that the family in the photograph has a young son . This seems unlikely as the Volvo is a new car and Mr. Ulman stated that although they had a child he was now grown . \n In the 1980s , college student Samantha Hughes ( Jocelin Donahue ) inspects a house she wishes to rent . Due to Samantha reminding her of her own daughter , landlady ( Dee Wallace ) forgoes a deposit in favour of one month 's rent in advance . Samantha is struggling financially so takes on a babysitting job for Mr. Ulman ( Tom Noonan ) and his wife ( Mary Woronov ) . Ulman asks to meet her but stands her up , later apologizing and offering to pay double the original salary . Samantha accepts and gets a ride to the remote mansion from her best friend , Megan ( Greta Gerwig ) . At the house , Mr. Ulman pulls her aside and reveals that he does not have any children to be monitored ; the babysitting job is to attend to his wife 's ailing mother . Samantha balks but finally agrees when she is offered $400 for the job , a significant increase in her pay . Megan immediately leaves , citing Ulman 's lies and peculiar behavior , but she reluctantly promises to pick up Samantha later . \n Samantha , shaken by a number of issues at the house and being startled by the arrival of the pizza she ordered ( by the same man that killed Megan ) , dials 911 , but eventually manages to calm herself down . Drugs in the pizza eventually cause Samantha to pass out , just as she discovers activity behind a door leading to the third floor . When she comes to , she finds that she has been bound and gagged in the center of a Pentagram . As a lunar eclipse darkens the night sky , Mr. and Mrs. Ulman , along with the stranger , who is actually their son Victor , begin a bizarre ritual . Mother ( Danielle Noe ) is revealed to be a grotesque , witch - like figure . As part of the ritual she slices her arm and pours the blood into a goat skull . She uses the blood to draw occult symbols on Samantha 's stomach and forehead , and forces Samantha to drink her blood from the skull . \n The plot concerns a young college student ( Donahue ) who is hired as a babysitter at an isolated house and is soon caught up in bizarre and dangerous events as she fights for her life . The film combines elements of both the slasher film and haunted house subgenres while using the `` satanic panic '' of the 1980s as a central plot element . The film pays homage to horror films of the 1970s and 1980s , recreating the style of films of that era using filming techniques and similar technology to what was used then . The film 's opening text claims that it is based upon true events , a technique used in some horror films , such as The Amityville Horror and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre . \n The House of the Devil is a 2009 American horror film written , directed , and edited by Ti West , starring Jocelin Donahue , Tom Noonan , and Mary Woronov . \n The United States premiere was at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival in New York City on April 25 . It was made available through video on demand on October 1 , 2009 . The film was given a limited theatrical release in the United States on October 30 , 2009 . The DVD and Blu - ray of the film were released on February 2 , 2010 . A promotional copy of the film was released on VHS in a clamshell box like the ones that many early VHS films of the 1980s came in . \n The soundtrack for The House of the Devil was released in November 2009 as a double feature with the score of I Can See You , both by composer Jeff Grace .",

    "answers": "",
    "context": "Since completely slick tyres are outlawed on most roads due to their inability to handle wet pavement , the `` cheater slick '' became a popular item in the hot rod world in the 1960s ; a typical slick type tyre , but engraved with the absolute minimal amount of tread grooves required to satisfy legal requirements . Since then , however , tyre development has progressed greatly , so that today 's hot rod street cars typically use wide , grooved tyres which perform better than the slicks of the past ; while the cheater slicks available today , both for nostalgic appearance of street cars and for competition use in classes where DOT approved street tyres are required , have followed their own line of development , diverging from true slick tyre construction to become a distinct tyre design in themselves . \n A racing slick ( also known as a `` slick tyre '' ) is a type of tyre that has a smooth tread used mostly in auto racing . The first production `` slick tyre '' was developed by M&H Tires in the early 1950s for use in drag racing . By eliminating any grooves cut into the tread , such tyres provide the largest possible contact patch to the road , and maximize traction for any given tyre dimension . Slick tyres are used on road or oval track racing , where steering and braking require maximum traction from each wheel , but are typically used on only the driven ( powered ) wheels in drag racing , where the only concern is maximum traction to put power to the ground . \n The development in cheater slick technology has affected the development of tyres for racing series other than drag racing as well . When other forms of auto racing similarly instituted classes which require DOT approved street tyres , some manufacturers similarly began to market tyres which superficially resembled their high performance street tyres , but with the least tread pattern permissible and with very soft , sticky rubber , intended specifically for competition because the soft tread would wear too quickly for street use . These became known , loosely , as R compound tyres . With additional years of progress , this class of tyre has in its turn followed its own line of development , to the point where they have little in common with true street tyres of the same brand . This has led to new classes of racing which require not only DOT approval , but also a minimum treadwear rating , in an effort to eliminate the R compound tyres from competition and require `` true '' street tyres . \n Slick tyres are not suitable for use on common road vehicles , which must be able to operate in all weather conditions . They are used in auto racing where competitors can choose different tyres based on the weather conditions and can often change tyres during a race . Slick tyres provide far more traction than grooved tyres on dry roads , due to their greater contact area but typically have far less traction than grooved tyres under wet conditions . Wet roads severely diminish the traction because of aquaplaning due to water trapped between the tyre contact area and the road surface . Grooved tyres are designed to remove water from the contact area through the grooves , thereby maintaining traction even in wet conditions . \n Since there is no tread pattern , slick tyre tread does not deform much under load . The reduced deformation allows the tyre to be constructed of softer compounds without excessive overheating and blistering . Modern day slick tyres have now developed particular performance qualities in a specific window of temperatures , becoming `` sticky '' when accumulating enough heat , and thus give much greater adhesion to the road surface , but it also has a lower treadwear rating ; i.e. it wears out much more quickly than the harder rubber tyres used for driving on the streets . It is not uncommon for drivers in some auto sports to wear out multiple sets of tyres during a single day 's driving . \n `` Wrinklewall '' slicks are now specifically designed for the special requirements of drag racing , being constructed in such a way as to allow the sidewall to be twisted by the torque applied at launch , softening the initial start and thus reducing the chances of breaking traction . As speed builds , the centrifugal force generated by the tyre 's rotation `` unwraps '' the sidewall , returning the energy to the car 's acceleration . Additionally , it causes the tyres to expand radially , increasing their diameter and effectively creating a taller gear ratio , allowing a higher top speed with the same transmission gearing . \n In contrast , many bicycle tyres made for street use are slick . Aquaplaning does not present a problem for bicycles due to their narrower width , higher pressure , lower speed , and circular cross section ( due to the need to lean the bicycle in turns ) ; the bicycle tyre can penetrate the water layer to contact the road much more easily . In practice , grooved bicycle tyres do not outperform slick tyres on wet roads . However , many low and medium performance bicycle tyres have substantial tread depth , because the bicycles are designed with off - road excursions in mind : in dirt , gravel or sand , the tread pattern provides significantly improved traction . In addition , high - performance bicycle tyres , although designed for road use only , often have a very fine tread pattern , which appears to provide no difference in performance versus a slick tyre and is only there for marketing purposes and as a tyre - wear indicator . This is clear not only from direct testing of tyres , but also from the fact that the texture of the road is itself coarser than the minimal tread pattern on these tyres . Some grooveless designs have small `` holes '' or dimples embedded in the tread as a tyre - wear indicator . This is similar to automobile tyre - wear indicator bars , which contact the road when the tyre is worn to a low tread amount , making the tyre noisy on the road . \n The first drag racing slick was developed by a company called M&H Tires ( Marvin & Harry Tires ) in the early 1950s . It was the only company in the world that produced and sold original drag racing tyres . \n Drag racing slicks vary in size , from slicks used on motorcycles to very wide ones used on Top Fuel dragsters . For `` closed wheel '' cars , often the car must be modified merely to account for the size of the slick , raising the body on the rear springs for the height of narrower slicks , and / or replacing the rear wheel housings with very wide `` tubs '' and narrowing the rear axle to allow room for the wider varieties of tyres . Open wheel dragsters are freed from any such constraint , and can go to enormous tyre sizes ( the opposite of tripodal which are quite minuscule ) . Some use very low pressures to maximize the tread contact area , producing the typical sidewall appearance which leads to their being termed `` wrinklewall '' slicks . Inner tubes are typically used , to ensure that the air does not suddenly leak catastrophically as the tyre deforms under the stress of launching . \n In Formula One , slick tyres were banned from the 1998 to 2008 seasons . Dry weather tyres with mandatory circumferential grooves intended to reduce total grip and reduce cornering speeds were used , but were still often referred to as `` slicks '' as the grooves were not intended to disperse water and could not be used effectively in wet conditions . Slick tyres were reintroduced from the 2009 season .",

    "answers": "",
    "context": "The first musician he worked with after leaving the Bee Gees was Jonathan Kelly . Petersen produced some of his early solo singles , and in 1970 the two decided to form a band together . It was called , Humpy Bong , a two - word variation of the name of the school that Petersen and the Gibb brothers attended in Australia . As they needed additional musicians , they placed an advertisement . Tim Staffell answered and he got the job as singer and harmonica player . The trio recorded their debut single and appeared on BBC Television 's Top of the Pops . Before the end of 1970 the group broke up without having played any concerts . \n Petersen managed Jonathan Kelly as a solo artist during the early 1970s , subsequent to Humpy Bong disbanding . He returned to Australia in 1974 where , having lost his rights to royalties after his court case against the Bee Gees , eventually became a painter residing in Sydney . He remained close to Melouney , but became bitter towards his other ex-bandmates about his lost royalties . \n Petersen was required to register for National Service and was called up on 11 March 1966 , but he was found medically unfit to serve in the army . ( National Archives of Australia -- Series J1687 ) \n Petersen described the contrasting dispositions of the Gibb brothers as follows : \n As Petersen learned about the music industry , he raised questions about Stigwood 's conflict of interest as the Bee Gees ' manager , since Stigwood owned their recordings and publishing and was in effect their employer . According to Petersen this led to him being fired in August 1969 , while the group were making a television film of Cucumber Castle . Petersen had already recorded the songs used in the film , which make up part of the album , but he is not credited on the sleeve . Pentangle drummer Terry Cox was brought in to complete the remainder of the drum tracks , but it is not really clear which tracks have Petersen or Cox on drums . \n Frederick Colin Petersen ( born 24 March 1946 ) is an Australian drummer , record producer and former child actor . He played as a member of the bands Steve and the Board , the Bee Gees and Humpy Bong . In August 1969 , he left the Bee Gees and he was replaced by Pentangle drummer Terry Cox to record the songs for their 1970 album Cucumber Castle . \n `` Colin is a very level - headed person , despite being a racing car enthusiast . He 's a very sophisticated person . He has a good appreciation of good food and wines . He 's 100 per cent professional in everything he does and he 's an old professional like the Gibbs because he 's been in entertainment as a child as they were , too '' \n Frederick Colin Petersen began his acting career at the age of seven . When he was still nine years old in late 1955 , he starred in the film Smiley ( released in 1956 ) , with Ralph Richardson , but by the time he was twelve in 1958 he was forced to cease acting as his mother felt it was interfering with his education . Other film credits included The Scamp ( 1957 ) , A Cry from the Streets ( 1958 ) and , much later , Barney ( 1976 ) . In 1958 , before his mother took him back to Australia , he was screen tested for the part of the young hero in Tiger Bay , but the part eventually went to the then 12 years old Hayley Mills instead , the part being rewritten for a girl . He attended the Humpybong State School at the same time that Barry , Robin , and Maurice Gibb did ( they went to Scarborough State School first , and then later went to Humpybong ) . Petersen was in Barry 's class , though they seldom crossed paths in any significant way . While at school he developed an interest in music , starting out on piano but switching to drums . After leaving school he played with several bands including Steve and the Board , and became acquainted with Maurice Gibb , who invited him to sit in on one of the trio 's sessions in Sydney . He ended up becoming friends with the family and ultimately played on as many as a dozen of the Bee Gees ' early Australian sides . \n Vince Melouney and Robin Gibb had already left the band by then , leaving just Barry Gibb , Maurice Gibb , and Colin Petersen . He was fired , allegedly for having lost interest in the group and missing recording sessions , and for his refusal to do any acting in the film , despite his experience in front of the cameras . \n `` They have totally different personalities , Robin is a very temperamental and very highly strung person . His music is his whole life and he is highly sensitive to criticism . Barry is a very easy - going and receptive type . He adapts himself to the situations he finds himself in at the time . He is very interested in the potential acting possibilities of the group . I think he would like to be a film star more than a singer . Maurice is closer to my attitudes and ideas . He has the same kind of humour as I have . We have other common interests like playing chess . He 's the kind of guy who will come over and give you a hand washing the car . As brothers , they really have very little in common , except the feeling that they are living for the day '' . \n As a partner in the group , however , he could not be summarily fired as though he were an employee . The result was a series of lawsuits in which , at one point -- as a ploy to get a quicker settlement from Stigwood -- he attempted to block the Bee Gees from using that name , since it was jointly owned by the partners , and he alleged that he had been illegally deprived of his share in the partnership . Petersen remained on good terms with the brothers , especially Robin Gibb , after his initial exit . \n On 1 June 1968 , Petersen married Joanne Newfield in Nassau , Bahamas , with fellow Bee Gees member Vince Melouney as the best man . Joanne had worked as a personal assistant to Brian Epstein up until his death , and then for Robert Stigwood . After the couple 's wedding Petersen and Newfield went on honeymoon in Majorca , which was spoiled somewhat when Joanne fell ill with German measles . In 1969 , Petersen and his wife began a management company . \n Petersen moved to England in 1966 , little knowing that the Bee Gees would soon be doing the same and they recruited him as their permanent drummer shortly afterwards -- the first non-Gibb brother to become an official member of the Bee Gees . He played on the albums Bee Gees ' 1st , Horizontal , Idea , Odessa , and Cucumber Castle . He was an equal partner in the group from early in their period in the UK , and the Gibb brothers regarded his playing as essential to their sound . He and fellow band member Vince Melouney , who would play lead guitar and had also moved to the UK , had some trouble when , in the late summer of 1967 , they were threatened with deportation because of an error in the way they had secured their visas . That problem was solved only by the intervention of the group 's manager , Robert Stigwood , who mounted a publicity campaign that embarrassed the government into permitting them to remain in the UK . While he was a Bee Gee , he and Maurice Gibb wrote `` Everything That Came From Mother Goose '' with lead vocals and guitar by Colin , but it was not released and also in 1968 , Petersen played drums on The Marbles ' debut single `` Only One Woman '' . \n The Bee Gees ' manager Robert Stigwood said about Petersen :",

In 1970 , Helms recorded an entire album titled Jingle Bell Rock on Certron C - 7013 , releasing the title track on Certron C - 10021 , with a picture sleeve . In yet another re-recording , Helms released a version on Ashley AS - 4200 ( year unknown ) . In 1983 , Helms released his last recording of `` Jingle Bell Rock '' on Black Rose 82713 . \n `` Jingle Bell Rock '' has been performed by many , but Helms ' version is the best known . The song 's title and some of its lyrics are an extension of the old Christmas standard , `` Jingle Bells . '' It makes brief references to other popular songs of the 1950s , such as `` Rock Around the Clock , '' and mentions going to a `` Jingle hop . '' An electric guitar played by Hank Garland can be heard playing the first notes of the chorus of `` Jingle Bells . '' Backup singers were the Anita Kerr Quartet . \n `` Jingle Bell Rock '' is an American popular Christmas song first released by Bobby Helms in 1957 ( after it was recorded in October 1957 ) . It has received frequent airplay in the United States during every Christmas season since then . `` Jingle Bell Rock '' was composed by Joseph Carleton Beal ( 1900 -- 1967 ) and James Ross Boothe ( 1917 -- 1976 ) . Beal was a Massachusetts - born public relations professional and longtime resident of South Ocean Avenue in Atlantic City , New Jersey , and Boothe was an American writer in the advertising business . \n Helms ' original version charted at No. 13 on Billboard 's Most Played C&W by Jockeys chart , a predecessor to the Hot Country Songs chart . It also crossed to the pop charts , peaking at No. 6 on the Billboard Best Sellers in Stores chart , and at No. 11 on Cashbox magazine 's Top 60 on the week ending January 11 , 1958 . \n The Helms version entered the Billboard Hot 100 chart on the week ending December 24 , 2016 , eventually reaching a peak of No. 29 two weeks later . \n As of November 25 , 2016 , total sales of the digital track of Helms ' original Decca recording stand at 780,000 downloads according to Nielsen SoundScan , placing it ninth on the list of all - time best - selling Christmas / holiday digital singles in SoundScan history . \n After the song was featured on the soundtrack album to the 1996 film Jingle All the Way , the original Bobby Helms version returned to the Billboard country singles charts in late 1996 and early 1997 , reaching a peak of No. 60 . \n The song is featured in the opening of Lethal Weapon ( 1987 ) .

    "context": "Melissa Manchester has paid tribute to Dusty Springfield by performing the song live in recent years . \n In 1994 , the song was featured in a scene of the film Pulp Fiction . The film 's soundtrack reached No. 21 on the Billboard 200 and went platinum ( 100,000 units ) in Canada alone . `` Son of a Preacher Man '' helped to sell over two million units of the album and to help it reach number six on the charts according to SoundScan . Quentin Tarantino has been quoted , on the `` Collectors Edition '' DVD of Pulp Fiction , as saying that he probably would not have filmed the scene in which the song is featured had he not been able to use it . \n The song was recorded by Franklin 's older sister Erma , who included it on her 1969 Brunswick album Soul Sister . Not till after hearing Springfield 's version did Franklin reconsider ; when she did release the song herself , including it on her 1970 album , This Girl 's in Love with You , her version charted only as a less popular a-side of the b - side hit single `` Call Me . '' \n In 1967 , while working at Muscle Shoals , Alabama , songwriters John Hurley and Ronnie Wilkins , who had recently had a hit with `` Love of the Common People , '' were asked by Jerry Wexler to write a song for Aretha Franklin . Remembering the fact that Franklin 's father was a preacher , as Wilkins 's grandfather had been , Hurley and Wilkins quickly came up with the song `` Son of a Preacher Man . '' Wexler liked the song and recorded it with Aretha Franklin , but then decided that it did not fit with her other songs and passed the song on to Dusty Springfield for her album Dusty in Memphis . \n The writers of Rolling Stone magazine placed Dusty Springfield 's recording at No. 77 among The 100 Best Singles of the Last 25 Years in 1987 . The record was placed at No. 43 of the Greatest Singles of All Time by the writers of New Musical Express in 2002 . In 2004 , the song made the Rolling Stone list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time at No. 240 . \n Samples from `` Son of a Preacher Man '' were used on Cypress Hill 's `` Hits from the Bong '' on their album Black Sunday . \n The song is also featured in the 2016 video game Mafia III . \n Springfield 's version was produced by Jerry Wexler , Tom Dowd and Arif Mardin for her first album for the Atlantic Records label and became an international hit reaching No. 10 in the United States and No. 9 in her native Great Britain when it was released in late 1968 . The album Dusty in Memphis was released in stereo , though its singles were remixed and released in mono . `` Son of a Preacher Man '' was to be the last Top Ten chart hit for Springfield for almost 20 years , till she teamed up with Pet Shop Boys for the single `` What Have I Done to Deserve This ? '' in 1987 . \n `` Son of a Preacher Man '' is a song written and composed by John Hurley and Ronnie Wilkins and recorded by British singer Dusty Springfield in September 1968 for the album Dusty in Memphis . \n The song is also featured in the film Enron : The Smartest Guys in the Room , during scenes depicting Kenneth Lay , ex-Enron CEO and son of a Baptist minister , and on an episode of Hindsight . In the 2008 television episode of the American series The Office titled `` Baby Shower , '' ( Jan Levinson ) ) , played by Melora Hardin , is filmed singing `` Son of a Preacher Man '' as a lullaby to her newborn daughter Astrid . Later in the same episode , Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) describes the bizarre scene to his fiancee , Pam Beesley ( Jenna Fischer ) , noting that the song is about `` losing your virginity next to a church .

'' \n The song is featured in the music - related video games Lips ( as downloadable content ) , Karaoke Revolution Presents : American Idol Encore , Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party , and Band Hero . \n Country music artist Jack Ingram released a version of the song in December 2006 . Ingram 's version , the lead - off single to his 2007 album This Is It , reached a peak of number 16 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in April 2007 . Ingram 's version does not include the last stanza where the singer once again asks why she is calling so late . \n `` Lips of an Angel '' is a ballad by American rock band Hinder . It was released as the second single from their album Extreme Behavior . It was their breakthrough hit , charting in the top ten on several Billboard trade charts in the United States , and reaching number one in several countries . It has sold 3.6 million copies in the US as of January 2015 , making it one of the most downloaded rock songs . \n The song experienced the most success in Oceania . On the chart date of February 4 , 2007 , the song debuted atop Australia 's ARIA Singles Chart , replacing Evermore 's `` Light Surrounding You '' , keeping the peak position for seven weeks before being replaced by `` Straight Lines '' by Silverchair . On February 12 , it reached the top spot on New Zealand 's RIANZ Singles Chart and stayed there for one more week before being dethroned by `` This Ai n't a Scene , It 's an Arms Race '' by Fall Out Boy . In the United States , the song reached number one on the Billboard Pop 100 and the Mainstream Top 40 charts in November 2006 . Elsewhere , the song had limited chart success , and remains their only hit in most countries it charted in . \n Jack Ingram released a cover of the song in 2006 , which reached No. 16 on the Billboard country music charts . \n Premiering in early 2007 , the music video for `` Lips of an Angel '' was directed by Shaun Silva and largely follows the narrative of the song 's lyrics , focusing on a late night phone call between the raconteur ( Austin Winkler ) and his former lover ( Emmanuelle Chriqui ) . \n The lyrics deal with the singer describing his feelings when his favored girlfriend from his past calls late at night , somewhat pleasantly interrupting his current relationship . More than once , a reference to the call being secret is made , and the singer expresses concern of a fight ensuing as a result . The song concludes just as it began , with the singer questioning to why she is calling so late . However , at the end , it is less literal and more figurative , with the underlying meaning of `` so late '' not at night , but too late in life , perhaps adding an element of sadness to the song , as it ends with the plot unresolved . According to a radio interview done in Atlanta , Georgia the lyrics are loosely based on an actual phone call incident that did happen . \n Regarding his cover of this song , Ingram gave an explanation in the liner notes of This Is It :",

    "context": "Master seaman or matelot - chef \n Badge of tracking radar operators \n Some sailors and Coast Guardsmen receive a rating following completion of a military technical training course for that particular rating known as an `` A '' school . Other sailors and Coast Guardsmen who have completed the requirements to be assigned a rating and have been accepted by the Navy Personnel Command / Bureau of Naval Personnel ( USN ) or the Coast Guard Personnel Service Center Command ( USCG ) as holding that rating ( a process called `` striking '' ) are called `` designated strikers '' , and are referred to by their full rate and rating in formal communications ( i.e. , machinist 's mate fireman ( MMFN ) , as opposed to simply fireman ( FN ) ) , though the rating is often left off in informal communications . Those who have not officially been assigned to a rating are officially referred to as `` undesignated '' or `` non-rates . '' Once selected for a particular rating of their choice they become eligible for advancement in that community . \n In the United States , it means the lowest three enlisted rates of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard , followed by the higher petty officer ranks . The equivalent of the seaman is the matelot in French - speaking countries , and Matrose in German - speaking countries . \n The German rank of `` seaman '' ( German : Matrose ) is the lowest enlisted rank of the German Navy . It is equivalent to OR1 in NATO and is a grade A3 in the pay rules of the Federal Ministry of Defence . \n Matelot breveté ( able seaman ) \n The Italian rank of `` seaman '' ( Italian : comune di seconda classe ) is the lowest enlisted rank of the Italian Navy equivalent in NATO to OR1 . \n Badge of technics and mechanics \n The Royal Australian Navy features one Seaman rank , which is split into two distinct classes . Seaman and Seaman * ( pronounced Seaman Star ) , to differentiate between those who have completed their employment training and those who are in training . There is no insignia on a Seaman rank slide . \n In the Royal Navy the rate is split into two divisions : AB1 and AB2 . The AB2 rating is used for those who have not yet completed their professional taskbooks . The rate of ordinary seaman has been discontinued . \n The actual title for an E-3 in the U.S. Navy varies based on the subset of the Navy or Coast Guard , also known as a group rate , to which the member will ultimately be assigned . Likewise , the color of their group rate mark also depends on that subset of the Navy or Coast Guard in which they are serving and which technical rating they will eventually pursue . \n There is one grade of seaman in the Hellenic Navy . \n The rank of master seaman is unique because it was created only for the Canadian Navy . It does not follow the British tradition of other Canadian ranks . It corresponds to the rank of master corporal / caporal - chef . \n Leading seaman or matelot de première classe \n Ordinary seaman or matelot de troisième classe \n Seaman is a naval rank and is either the lowest or one of the lowest ranks in most navies around the world . In the Commonwealth it is the lowest rank in the navy . The next rank up is able seaman , followed by leading seaman , which is followed by the petty officer ranks . \n Much Russian military vocabulary was imported , along with military advisers , from Germany in the 16th and 17th centuries . The Russian word for `` seaman '' or `` sailor '' ( Russian : матрос ; matros ) was borrowed from the German `` matrose '' . In Imperial Russia the most junior naval rank was `` seaman 2nd class '' ( матрос 2 - й статьи ; matros vtoroi stati ) . The 1917 Revolution led to the term `` Red Fleet man '' ( краснофлотец ; krasnoflotets ) until 1943 , when the Soviet Navy reintroduced the term `` seaman '' ( матрос ; matros ) , along with badges of rank . The Russian federation inherited the term in 1991 , as did several other former Soviet republics , including Ukraine , Azerbaijan and Belarus , with Bulgaria using the same word and the same Cyrillic orthography . Estonia ( Estonian : mаtrus ) and Latvia ( Latvian : mаtrozis ) use closely related loanwords . \n The term `` seaman '' is also a general - purpose for a man or a woman who works anywhere on board a modern ship , including in the engine spaces , which is the very opposite of sailing . This is untrue in the US Navy where a sailor might be a seaman but not all US Navy sailors are a ' Seaman ' as they might be an Airman , Fireman , Constructionman , or Hospital Corpsman . Furthermore , `` seaman '' is a short form for the status of an `` able - bodied seaman , '' either in the navies or in the merchant marines . An able - bodied seaman is one who is fully trained and qualified to work on the decks and superstructure of modern ships , even during foul weather , whereas less - qualified sailors are restricted to remaining within the ship during times of foul weather -- lest they be swept overboard by the stormy seas or by the high winds . \n Able seaman or matelot de deuxième classe \n Matelot 2e classe ( seaman 2nd class ) , or apprentice seaman , and matelot breveté ( able seaman ) are designations of the French Navy . Matelots are colloquially known as `` mousses '' . \n In the Indonesian Navy this rank is referred to as `` Kelasi '' ( read : Kelasee ) . There are three levels of this rank in the Indonesian Navy which are : `` Seaman Recruit '' ( Kelasi Dua ) , `` Seaman Apprentice '' ( Kelasi Satu ) , and `` Seaman '' ( Kelasi Kepala ) , the rating system thus mirrors the one used in the US Navy . \n Madrus is the lowest rank in the Estonian Navy . It is equivalent to OR - 1 in NATO \n Seaman is the third enlisted rank from the bottom in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard , ranking above seaman apprentice and below petty officer third class . This naval rank was formerly called `` seaman first class '' . The rank is also used in United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps , a naval - themed uniformed youth program under the sponsorship of the Navy League of the United States . \n No such stripes for E-1 , E-2 or E-3 are authorized to be worn on working uniforms , e.g. , navy work uniform , USCG operational dress uniform , coveralls , utility wear , flight suits , hospital and clinic garb , diving suits , etc . However , sailors with the pay grade of E-2 or E-3 are permitted to wear silver - anodized collar devices on their service uniforms . \n Badge of electro - mechanics \n There are 4 grades of seaman / matelot in the Royal Canadian Navy :",

The most recent was constituted in 2013 and is chaired by Y.V. Reddy , former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India . \n The Finance Commission was established in 1951 by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar , the then - incumbent Law Minister , to address these imbalances . Several provisions to bridge the fiscal gap between the Centre and the States were already enshrined in the Constitution of India , including Article 268 , which facilitates levy of duties by the Centre but equips the States to collect and retain the same . Similarly , Articles 269 , 270 , 275 , 282 and 293 , among others , specify ways and means of sharing resources between the Union and States . In addition to the above provisions , the Finance Commission serves as an institutional framework to facilitate Centre - State Transfers . \n As a federal state , India suffers from both vertical and horizontal fiscal imbalances . Vertical imbalances between the central and state governments result from states incurring expenditures disproportionate to their sources of revenue , in the process of fulfilling their responsibilities . However , states are better able to gauge the needs and concerns of their inhabitants and therefore more efficient at addressing them . Horizontal imbalances among state governments result from differing historical backgrounds or resource endowments , and can widen over time . \n A member may be disqualified if : \n Major Recommendations of 14th Finance Commission headed by Prof. YV Reddy \n The Commission has the power to determine their own procedure and : \n It is alleged that Planning Commission ( India ) ( PC ) which is neither a constitutional nor a statutory body has usurped the role of Finance Commission ( FC ) . PC has restricted FC 's role to mere recommend grants to states on revenue account only under article 275 of Indian constitution . However , after the formation of NITI Aayog ( National Institute of Transforming India ) , which comes to replace the Planning Commission seeks to empower FC with the originally envisaged task of distribution of revenue to the states . \n Since the institution of the first Finance Commission , stark changes in the macroeconomic situation of the Indian economy have led to major changes in the Finance Commission 's recommendations over the years . \n Every member will be in office for the time period as specified in the order of the President , but is eligible for reappointment provided he has , by means of a letter addressed to the president , resigned his office . \n The Finance Commission was established by the President of India in 1951 under Article 280 of the Indian Constitution .

    "answers": "",
    "context": "`` Random reboot '' is a non-technical term referring to an unintended ( and often undesired ) reboot following a system crash , whose root cause may not immediately be evident to the user . Such crashes may occur due to a multitude of software and hardware problems , such as triple faults . They are generally symptomatic of an error in ring 0 that is not trapped by an error handler in an operating system or a hardware - triggered non-maskable interrupt . \n Unexpected loss of power for any reason ( including power outage , power supply failure or depletion of battery on a mobile device ) forces the system user to perform a cold boot once the power is restored . Some BIOSes have an option to automatically boot the system after a power failure . An uninterruptible power supply ( UPS ) , backup battery or redundant power supply can prevent such circumstances . \n Outside the domain of IBM compatible PCs , the types of boot may not apply . According to Sue Loh of Windows CE Base Team , Windows CE devices support three types of boots : Warm , cold and clean . A warm boot discards `` program memory '' area . A cold boot also discards the contents of `` storage memory '' area ( also known as `` object store '' ) . A clean boot erases all forms of storage memories for the device . However , since these areas do not exist on all Windows CE devices , users are only concerned with two forms of reboot : One that resets the volatile memory and one that wipes the device clean and restores factory settings . For example , for a Windows Mobile 5.0 device , the former is a cold boot and the latter is a clean boot . \n Systems may be configured to reboot automatically after a power failure , or a fatal system error or kernel panic . The method by which this is done varies depending whether the reboot can be handled in software , or must be handled at the firmware or hardware level . Operating systems in the Windows NT family ( from Windows NT 3.1 through Windows 7 ) have an option to modify the behavior of the error handler so that a computer immediately restarts rather than displaying a Blue Screen of Death ( BSOD ) error message . This option is enabled by default on some editions . \n The means performing a deliberate reboot also varies and may include : \n According to Jones , Landes , Tittel ( 2002 ) , Cooper ( 2002 ) , Tulloch ( 2002 ) and Soper ( 2004 ) , on IBM PC compatible platform , a cold boot is a boot process in which the computer starts from a powerless state . All except Tulloch ( 2002 ) also mention that in cold boot , system performs a power - on self - test ( POST ) . In addition to the power switch , Cooper ( 2002 ) and Soper ( 2004 ) also state that reset button may commence a cold reboot . Jones , Landes , Tittel ( 2002 ) contradicts this assertion and states that a reset button may commence either a cold or warm reboot , depending on the system . Microsoft Support article 102228 also confers that although the reset button is designed to perform a cold reboot , it may not disconnect the power to the motherboard -- a state that does not correspond to the cold boot definition given above . According to Jones , Landes , Tittel ( 2002 ) , both the operating system and third - party software can initiate a cold boot ; the restart command in Windows 9x initiates a cold reboot , unless Shift key is held . \n The introduction of advanced power management allowed operating systems greater control of hardware power management features . With Advanced Configuration and Power Interface ( ACPI ) , newer operating systems are able to manage different power states and thereby sleep and / or hibernate . While hibernation also involves turning a system off then subsequently back on again , the operating system does not start from scratch , therefore differentiating this process from rebooting . \n Technical sources describe two contrasting forms of reboot known as cold reboot ( also cold boot , hard reboot or hard boot ) and warm reboot ( also warm boot , soft reboot or soft boot ) although the definition of these forms slightly vary between sources . \n The Linux family of operating systems support an alternative to warm boot -- the Linux kernel has optional support for kexec , a system call which transfers execution to a new kernel and skips hardware or firmware reset . The entire process occurs independently of the system firmware . The kernel being executed does not have to be a Linux kernel . \n Windows 8 & 10 enable ( by default ) a hibernation - like `` Fast Startup '' ( a.k.a `` Fast Boot '' ) which can cause problems ( including confusion ) for users accustomed to turning off computers to ( cold ) reboot them . \n Early electronic computers ( like the 1401 ) had no operating system and little internal memory . The input was often a stack of punch cards . The computer was initiated by pressing a start button that performed a single command , read a card . This first card then instructed the machine to read more cards that eventually loaded a user program . This process was likened to an old saying , `` picking yourself up by the bootstraps '' , referring to a horseman who lifts himself off the ground by pulling on the straps of his boots . This set of initiating punch cards was called `` bootstrap cards '' . Thus a cold start was called booting the computer up . If the computer crashed , it was rebooted . The boot reference carried over to all subsequent types of computers . For more , see Bootstrapping . \n Finding a definition for warm boot , however , is more of a challenge . All aforementioned sources indicate that a warm boot is initiated by pressing Ctrl + Alt + Delete key combination ; all except Tulloch ( 2002 ) mention that a warm reboot does not perform POST . Jones , Landes , Tittel ( 2002 ) specifies that for a warm reboot to occur , BIOS must be the recipient of the key combination . Microsoft Support article 102228 takes a more technical approach and defines a warm boot a result of invoking INT 19h , a BIOS interrupt call ; the Ctrl + Alt + Delete key combination is only one of the ways . According to Grimes ( 2001 ) , malware may prevent or subvert a warm boot by intercepting Ctrl + Alt + Delete key combination and prevent it from reaching BIOS . Windows NT family of operating systems also does the same and reserves the key combination for its own use . Soper ( 2004 ) asserts that Windows restart command initiates a warm boot , thus contradicting Jones , Landes , Tittel ( 2002 ) that believes the same action performs a cold boot . \n In computing , re booting is the process by which a running computer system is restarted , either intentionally or unintentionally . Reboots can be either cold ( alternatively known as hard ) where the power to the system is physically turned off and back on again , causing an initial boot of the machine , or warm ( alternatively known as soft ) where the system restarts without the need to interrupt the power . The term restart is used to refer to a reboot when the operating system closes all programs and finalizes all pending input and output operations before initiating a soft reboot . \n A hard reboot means that the system is not shut down in an orderly manner , skipping file system synchronisation and other activities that would occur on an orderly shutdown . This can be achieved by either applying a reset , by cycling power , by issuing the halt - q command in most Unix - like systems , or by triggering a kernel panic . \n A reboot may be simulated by software running on an operating system . For example : the Sysinternals BlueScreen utility , which is used for pranking ; or some modes of the bsod XScreenSaver `` hack '' , for entertainment ( albeit possibly concerning on first glance at the screen saver ) . Malware may also simulate a reboot , and thereby deceive a computer user for some nefarious purpose . \n Users may deliberately initiate a reboot . Rationale for such action may include : \n The term `` restart '' is used by Microsoft Windows and Linux family of operating systems to denote an operating system - assisted reboot . In a restart , the operating system ensures that all pending I / O operations are gracefully ended before commencing a reboot . \n Microsoft App - V sequencing tool captures all the file system operations of an installer in order to create a virtualized software package for users . As part of the sequencing process , it will detect when an installer requires a reboot , interrupt the triggered reboot , and instead simulate the required reboot by restarting services and loading / unloading libraries .",

    "context": "Clinical data indicates that more males have the condition than females , despite the fact that females scored higher on a social phobia scale than men , and report higher scores on proclivity towards feelings of embarrassment . This differs from Western society where the prevalence of females with social phobias is to some extent greater than that of males . The lifetime prevalence of the disorder falls anywhere between 3 % and 13 % with changes in severity occurring throughout one 's lifetime . It is estimated that about 17 % of individuals with taijin kyofusho have fears of releasing foul body odor . \n One source even breaks taijin kyofusho into two different subtypes : neurotic and offensive . The first subtype can be broken into two parts that are classical type and avoidant type . The classical type being afraid of being judged negatively because of physical signs of anxiety and feeling shame due to anxiety . The physical signs that can cause fear of being judged include sweating and tremors . The second subtype deals with people thinking something about them is offensive . Some of their fears include body odor , gas , excessive or insufficient eye contact , blushing , etc . \n Milnacipran , a serotonin -- norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( SNRI ) , is currently used in the treatment of taijin kyofusho and has been shown to be efficacious for the related social anxiety disorder . The primary aspect of treating this disorder is getting patients to focus their attention on their body parts and sensations . \n A person may be diagnosed with taijin kyofusho if they feel as if their attitudes , behavior , and physical characteristics are inadequate in social situations . As a result of these feelings , they also experience persistent suffering in the form of emotional distress through shame , embarrassment , anxiety , fear , and other tense feelings that occur when confronted with social circumstances . In addition , individuals also worry about being unable to maintain healthy relationships with others . When it comes to socializing , taijin kyofusho sufferers avoid painful social and interpersonal situations , while simultaneously being averse to doing so . Those likely to develop taijin kyofusho have more of a temperamental characteristic of being hypochondriacal . The balance between introversion and extroversion in hypochondriacal temperament is geared more towards introversion . The introversion causes sufferers to focus on themself and problems they have , and by fixating on their weaknesses they become more anxious and depressed . \n Japan psychology also recognizes additional types of taijin kyofusho based on severity : \n In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM - 5 ) , variants of taijin kyofusho ( shubo - kyofu and jikoshu - kyofu ) are listed under 300.3 ( F42 ) `` Other Specified Obsessive - Compulsive and Related Disorders '' . \n A problem with culture - bound syndromes is that they are resistant to some medicine. ) The standard Japanese treatment for taijin kyofusho is Morita therapy , developed by Shoma Morita in the 1910s as a treatment for the Japanese mental disorders taijin kyofusho and shinkeishitsu ( nervousness ) . The original regimen involved patient isolation , enforced bed rest , diary writing , manual labor , and lectures on the importance of self - acceptance and positive endeavor . Since the 1930s , the treatment has been modified to include out - patient and group treatments . This modified version is known as neo-Morita therapy . Medications have also gained acceptance as a treatment option for taijin kyofusho . Other treatments include systematic desensitization , which includes slowly exposing one self to the fear , and learning relaxation skills , to extinguish fear and anxiety . \n Taijin kyofusho ( 対人 恐怖 症 taijin kyōfushō , TKS , for taijin kyofusho symptoms ) is a Japanese culture - specific syndrome . The term taijin kyofusho translates into the disorder ( sho ) of fear ( kyofu ) of interpersonal relations ( taijin ) . Those who have taijin kyofusho are likely to be extremely embarrassed about themselves or fearful of displeasing others when it comes to the functions of their bodies or their appearances . These bodily functions and appearances include their faces , odor , actions , or even looks . They do not want to embarrass other people with their presence . This culture - bound syndrome is a social phobia based on fear and anxiety . \n Typically , this disease is presaged by a childhood history of social inhibition and shyness . It is possible that it could result from a humiliating traumatic experience , or it could emerge from a lifelong onset of the illness that only comes to the surface after time . \n The symptoms of this disorder include avoiding social outings and activities , rapid heartbeat , shortness of breath , panic attacks , trembling , and feelings of dread and panic when around people . The causes of this disorder are mainly from emotional trauma or psychological defense mechanism . It is more common in men than women . Lifetime prevalence is estimated at 3 -- 13 % . \n In the official Japanese diagnostic system , taijin kyofusho is subdivided into the following categories : \n Taijin kyofusho is commonly described as a form of social anxiety ( social phobia ) , with the person dreading and avoiding social contact , and as a subtype of shinkeishitsu ( anxiety disorder ) . However , instead of a fear of embarrassing themselves or being harshly judged by others because of their social ineptness , sufferers of taijin kyofusho report a fear of offending or harming other people . The focus is thus on avoiding harm to others rather than to oneself .",

    "answers": "",
    "context": "The lengthy articles in a leading daily newspaper reveal a late - Victorian metropolitan imagery of colonial space and time . Shaw projected vast empty spaces awaiting energetic English settlers and economic enterprise . Observing new landscapes from a rail carriage , for example , she selected images which served as powerful metaphors of time and motion in the construction of racial identities . \n She was born at 2 Dundas Terrace , Woolwich , South London , the fourth of fourteen children , the daughter of an English father , Captain ( later Major General ) George Shaw , and a French mother , Marie Adrienne Josephine ( née Desfontaines ; 1826 -- 1871 ) , a native of Mauritius . She had nine sisters , the first and the last dying in infancy , and four brothers . \n She thought that the term `` Sudan '' was associated with a territory in the Nile basin , the current Sudan . In The Times of 8 January 1897 , she wrote : `` The name Nigeria applying to no other part of Africa may without offence to any neighbours be accepted as co-extensive with the territories over which the Royal Niger Company has extended British influence , and may serve to differentiate them equally from the colonies of Lagos and the Niger Protectorate on the coast and from the French territories of the Upper Niger . '' \n Her belief in the positive benefits of the British Empire infused her writing . As a correspondent for The Times , Shaw sent back `` Letters '' in 1892 and 1893 from her travels in South Africa and Australia , later published in book form as Letters from South Africa ( 1893 ) . Writing for the educated governing circles , she focused on the prospects of economic growth and the political consolidation of self - governing colonies within an increasingly - united empire , with a vision largely blinkered to the force of colonial nationalisms and local self - identities . \n She also made two journeys to Canada , in 1893 and 1898 , the second including a journey to the gold diggings of Klondike . \n She married , on 10 June 1902 , Lugard , who , in 1928 , was created Baron Lugard . She accompanied him when he served as Governor of Hong Kong ( 1907 -- 1912 ) and Governor - General of Nigeria ( 1914 -- 1919 ) . They had no children . \n While they lived in Hong Kong she helped her husband establishing the University of Hong Kong . During the First World War , she was prominent in the founding of the War Refugees Committee , which dealt with the problem of the refugees from Belgium , and she founded the Lady Lugard Hospitality Committee . In the 1918 New Year Honours , she was appointed as a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire . \n Her first children 's novel , Castle Blair , was translated into several languages and continued to be extremely popular in the UK and the US well into the 20th century . It was based on her own Anglo - Irish childhood experiences . Charlotte Yonge recommended it along with works of `` some of the most respected and loved authors available in late Victorian England '' as `` wild ... attractive and exciting '' . The critic John Ruskin called Castle Blair `` good , and lovely , and true '' . \n She died of pneumonia on 25 January 1929 , aged 76 , in Surrey . \n Flora Louise Shaw , DBE ( born 19 December 1852 -- 25 January 1929 ) , was a British journalist and writer . She is credited with having coined the name `` Nigeria '' . \n When she first started writing for The Times , she wrote under the name of `` F. Shaw '' to try to disguise that she was a woman . Later , she was so highly regarded that she wrote openly as Flora Shaw . Her pseudonym is now little - known , and she was regarded as one of the greatest journalists of her time , specialising in politics and economics . \n Shaw was close to the three men who most epitomised empire in Africa : Rhodes , George Taubman Goldie and Sir Frederick Lugard . \n Flora was required to testify before the House of Commons Select Committee on British South Africa during the controversy on the Jameson Raid into the Transvaal on 29 December 1895 . The prominent journalist had corresponded frequently with those involved or suspected of involvement , including Cecil Rhodes , Leander Starr Jameson , Colonel Francis Rhodes , and Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain . She was exonerated from all charges . \n Shaw also wrote a history of Australia for children , The story of Australia ( London : Horace Marshall , 1897 ) , as part of the Story of the Empire series . \n Her paternal grandfather was Sir Frederick Shaw , third baronet ( 1799 -- 1876 ) , of Bushy Park , Dublin , and a member of parliament from 1830 to 1848 , regarded as the leader of the Irish Conservatives . Her paternal grandmother , Thomasine Emily , was the sixth daughter of the Hon . George Jocelyn , and granddaughter of Robert , first earl of Roden . \n Shaw first took advantage of a journalistic opportunity while she was staying with family friends , the Younghusbands , in Gibraltar in 1886 . There , over four months , she visited Zebehr Pasha , a slaver and former Sudanese governor , who was incarcerated there . Her reports purportedly led to his release . \n She began her career in journalism in 1886 , writing for the Pall Mall Gazette and the Manchester Guardian . She was sent by the Manchester Guardian newspaper and was the only woman reporter to cover the Anti-Slavery Conference in Brussels . She became Colonial Editor for The Times , which made her the highest paid woman journalist of the time . In that connection , she was sent as a special correspondent to Southern Africa in 1892 and in 1901 and to Australia and New Zealand in 1892 , partly to study the question of Kanaka labour in the sugar plantations of Queensland . Penneshaw , South Australia is partly named after her . \n From 1878 to 1886 , Shaw wrote five novels , four for children and one for young adults . In her books , young girls are encouraged to be resourceful and brave but in a traditional framework , acting in support of `` gentlemanly '' fathers and prospective husbands , rather than on their own behalf . Shaw 's ideology is both sexually conservative and imperialist . \n In an essay that first appeared in The Times on 8 January 1897 , by `` Miss Shaw '' , she suggested the name `` Nigeria '' for the British Protectorate on the Niger River . In her essay , Shaw made the case for a shorter term that would be used for the `` agglomeration of pagan and Mahomedan States '' to replace the official title , `` Royal Niger Company Territories '' . She thought that the term `` Royal Niger Company Territories '' was too long to be used as a name of a Real Estate Property , under the Trading Company in that part of Africa . She was in search of a new name , and she coined `` Nigeria '' , in preference to terms , such as `` Central Sudan '' , which were associated with the area by some geographers and travellers . \n In 1905 , Shaw wrote what remains the definitive history of Western Sudan and the modern settlement of Northern Nigeria , A Tropical Dependency : An Outline of the Ancient History of the Western Soudan , With an Account of the Modern Settlement of Northern Nigeria ( London : Nisbet , 1905 ) .",

    "context": "Rickman reprises the role in Alice Through the Looking Glass ( 2016 ) , though he remains a butterfly , leading Alice to the looking - glass portal to Underland and informing her that matters require her urgent attention . He is n't seen again for the rest of the film but makes a cameo in the credits . This was also his final film performance and the film is dedicated in his memory . \n Introduced in Chapter Four ( `` Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill '' ) and the main center of interest of Chapter V ( `` Advice from a Caterpillar '' ) , the Caterpillar is a hookah - smoking caterpillar exactly three inches high ( a height of which he argues in defense , against Alice 's complaint ) . Alice does not like the Caterpillar when they first meet , because he does not immediately talk to her and when he does , it is usually in short , rather rude sentences , or difficult questions . \n The Caterpillar ( also known as the Hookah - Smoking Caterpillar ) is a fictional character appearing in Lewis Carroll 's book Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland . \n His memorable phrase is a breathy `` Whooo ... are ... you ? '' . In the Disney animated film , this line is visualised as exhalations of smoke in the shapes `` O '' , `` R '' and `` U '' . Alice remarks in the original story that the Caterpillar will one day turn into a butterfly , and in both the 1999 television film and Disney 's 1951 version he does so in Alice 's presence . He is voiced by Richard Haydn . \n Alan Rickman voices the Caterpillar , who in this adaptation is named Absolem . Rickman was filmed while recording his voice in a studio , but his face was not composited onto the character 's face as originally planned . \n He appears five times in the movie . The first time is outside Wonderland , when a young man named Hamish Ascot is about to propose to Alice and she notices a blue caterpillar on his shoulder . The second time is when Nivens McTwisp the White Rabbit , Tweedledum and Tweedledee , Mallymkun the Dormouse , and the Uilleam the Dodo consider Alice 's identity , and they consult him . Absolem appears in a thick cloud of hookah smoke , which he blows at Alice . He appears again after Alice arrives at the White Queen 's Castle , and again to remind Alice of her previous visit to Wonderland . He blows smoke at her twice this time , and Alice asks him to stop it . At the end of the movie , Absolem , as a butterfly , appears on Alice 's shoulder as she sets off for China . \n The Caterpillar in the Disney film is a blue creature who , as in the original Carroll story , smokes a hookah . He is seen as a very violent character as he yells at Alice quite often during the scenes in which they both appear . He blows smoke in Alice 's face and when she needs assistance he ignores her . He is a quite mean character providing little to no assistance to Alice and ends up confusing her more while she is trapped in Wonderland . He then ignores her and turns into a butterfly and flutters away not caring whether or not Alice makes it out alive . He also instructs her to eat a mushroom but does not say what it does thus putting her into possible danger . He reappears one final time during the ending chase , still in butterfly form but once again smoking on his hookah , and again ignoring Alice when she asks for his help escaping the Queen of Hearts . \n The Caterpillar makes an appearance in a few other places outside Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland , such as American McGee 's Alice and the novel The Looking - Glass Wars ; in both of these spin - offs he plays the role of an oracle . \n The original illustration by John Tenniel is something of a visual paradox , wherein the caterpillar 's human face appears to be formed from the head and legs of a naturalistic caterpillar .",

He was the first player in school history to amass 1,000 yards rushing and passing in consecutive seasons . He totaled 2,600 yards rushing and 40 rushing touchdowns during his career and also passed for 2,500 yards and 18 touchdowns , leading the War Eagles to a 26 -- 3 record , including a 14 -- 1 record and state championship his senior year , when he was also named the Georgia 4A Offensive Player of the Year . \n McVay was born in Dayton , Ohio , the son of Tim and Cindy McVay . Sean 's father , Tim , played football as a defensive back at Indiana University . His family lived in Dayton until Sean was six years old . His grandfather , John McVay , is a former San Francisco 49ers general manager , who was involved in constructing the five Super Bowl winning seasons for the team . \n On January 12 , 2017 , McVay was hired to become the 28th head coach of the Los Angeles Rams at the age of 30 . The Rams had made him the youngest head coach in modern NFL history , surpassing Lane Kiffin , who was 31 when hired by the Oakland Raiders in 2007 . \n McVay resides in Los Angeles , California , with his girlfriend .

Despite a loss to McVay 's former team the Washington Redskins nonetheless , the Rams pulled off a close 41 -- 39 victory over the San Francisco 49ers and turned a 16 -- 24 deficit into a 35 -- 30 upset victory over the Dallas Cowboys , but the Rams eventually recorded another loss to division rival Seattle Seahawks at home . Regardless , in just five games , the Rams offense scored a total of 142 ( later 151 ) points a league leader and a franchise high . The Rams went on to beat the Jacksonville Jaguars on the road and the Arizona Cardinals in an NFL International Series game for the team 's first shutout win since 2014 , as well as raising their record to 5 -- 2 for the first time since 2004 ( the last time the team made the playoffs ) and a first place lead in the NFC West . McVay coached the Rams to a blowout against the New York Giants in their highest - scoring game yet , a 51 -- 17 victory , which raised the Rams ' record to 6 -- 2 . The Rams would score another win at home against the Houston Texans with a 33 -- 7 score in the second half to raise the record for the Rams to 7 -- 2 for their best record of the season since 2001 . In Week 12 , the Rams scored yet another win at home against the New Orleans Saints 26 - 20 to raise their record to 8 -- 3 . In Week 13 , on the road the Rams faced divisional rival Arizona Cardinals and won 32 -- 16 for their first winning season since 2003 . The next weeks : Week 14 , Week 15 , and Week 16 , McVay had two victories over the Seattle Seahawks in a 42 -- 7 blowout game and the Tennessee Titans in a close 27 -- 23 win though he still lost to the Philadelphia Eagles 43 -- 35 . McVay 's first season with the Rams has seen them dramatically improve their record from last season and the team 's first winning season since 2003 and its first playoff berth since 2004 . \n NFL head coaches under whom McVay has served : \n McVay began his coaching career as an assistant wide receivers coach with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2008 under head coach Jon Gruden .

Upon his hiring in 2017 at the age of 30 , he became the youngest head coach in modern NFL history . \n On January 14 , 2014 , McVay was promoted by new Redskins head coach , Jay Gruden , to offensive coordinator . In his first year as offensive coordinator , he turned the team 's offense into the 12th - ranked pass offense in the National Football League ( NFL ) -- averaging 268.4 passing yards per game with third year quarterback , Kirk Cousins -- the 17th - ranked rush offense , with 97.9 rushing yards per game , and the 10th ranked total offense in the NFL , a year after the team 's offense finished ranked 25th in total offense , averaging 24.3 points per game and 353.8 total yards per game .

    "context": "In addition to acting , Gordon was an accomplished author , penning two books in the 1940s entitled Nursery Rhymes for Hollywood Babies and Leaves from the Story Trees , and two one - act plays . After he and his wife purchased 150 acres ( 61 ha ) in Borrego Springs , Gordon did much of the construction of the house and his art studio himself . He also built and restored his own furniture on the property and used the land to become one of the few commercial carob growers in the United States . \n Gale Gordon ( born Charles Thomas Aldrich , Jr. , February 20 , 1906 -- June 30 , 1995 ) was an American character actor perhaps best remembered as Lucille Ball 's longtime television foil -- and particularly as cantankerously combustible , tightfisted bank executive Theodore J. Mooney , on Ball 's second television situation comedy , The Lucy Show . Gordon also appeared in I Love Lucy and had starring roles in Ball 's successful third series Here 's Lucy and her short - lived fourth and final series Life with Lucy . \n In 1950 , Gordon played John Granby in the radio series Granby 's Green Acres , which became the basis for the 1960s television series , Green Acres . Gordon went on to create the role of pompous principal Osgood Conklin on Our Miss Brooks , carrying the role to television when the show moved there in 1952 . In the interim , Gordon turned up as Rudolph Atterbury on My Favorite Husband , which starred Lucille Ball in a precursor to I Love Lucy . \n He is remembered for his role as school principal Osgood Conklin in the early 1950s television hit show Our Miss Brooks starring Eve Arden . Gordon was also a respected and beloved radio actor . He also co-starred as the second Mr. Wilson in Dennis the Menace . \n The widely acknowledged master of the `` slow - burn '' temper explosion in character , Gordon was the first pick to play Fred Mertz on I Love Lucy , but he was committed to Our Miss Brooks as well as being a regular on several other radio shows and declined the offer with William Frawley chosen for the role . He appeared in three guest shots on the show : twice as Ricky Ricardo 's boss , Alvin Littlefield , owner of the Tropicana Club where Ricky 's band played , and later as a judge on a Lucy - Desi Comedy Hour episode . \n After the sale of Desilu Studios , Ball shut down The Lucy Show in 1968 and retooled it into Here 's Lucy and became her own producer and distributor . She used Gordon again , this time as her irascible boss ( and brother - in - law ) Harrison Otis ' Uncle Harry ' Carter at an employment agency that specialized in unusual jobs for unusual people . In reality , it was just a continuation of the Lucy Carmichael / Mr. Mooney relationship , but with new names and a new setting . \n Gordon and Ball had previously worked together on The Wonder Show , starring Jack Haley , from 1938 -- 39 . The two had a long friendship as well as recurring professional partnership . Gordon also had a recurring role as fictitious Rexall Drugs sponsor representative Mr. Scott on yet another radio hit , The Phil Harris - Alice Faye Show , staying with the role as long as Rexall sponsored the show . \n In 1999 , Gordon was inducted posthumously into the Radio Hall of Fame , and for his contribution to radio he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6340 Hollywood Boulevard . \n From 1937 -- 39 , he starred as `` The Octopus '' in the Speed Gibson adventure series . In 1949 , Gordon recorded the pilot for The Halls of Ivy , starring in the program 's title role of Dr. Todhunter Hall , the president of Ivy College . The pilot led to a radio series that aired from 1950 -- 52 , but with Ronald Colman in the title role ; Gordon later joined the cast as a replacement for Willard Waterman in the popular role of John Merriweather . ( Waterman and Gordon both died in 1995 . ) \n Gordon had all but retired when Here 's Lucy ended ( he reprised the Mr. Mooney role in the first episode of Hi Honey , I 'm Home ! ) , but in the 1980s he came out of retirement to join Ball for the short - lived Life With Lucy . When Lucille Ball ended her career , Gordon was the only actor to have co-starred or guest - starred in every weekly series , radio or television , she had done since the 1940s . \n In 1962 , Ball created The Lucy Show and planned to hire Gordon to play Theodore J. Mooney , the banker who was first Lucy Carmichael 's executor and subsequently her employer , when she went to work in his bank . Gordon was under contract to play John Wilson ( after the death of Joseph Kearns , who played George Wilson ) on Dennis the Menace . Prior to Gordon 's replacing Kearns on Dennis the Menace , the two had worked together on an old radio show , The Cinnamon Bear . \n When Dennis the Menace ended in spring 1963 , Gordon joined The Lucy Show as Mr. Mooney for the 1963 - 64 season . ( In the interim , Charles Lane played the similar Mr. Barnsdahl character for the 1962 - 1963 season . ) The somewhat portly Gordon was adept at physical comedy and could do a perfect cartwheel . He did this on The Lucy Show and Here 's Lucy , and again as a guest on The Dean Martin Show . \n Beginning in 1949 , Gordon and his wife lived in the tiny community of Borrego Springs , California ( pop . 1,500 ) where he had a ranch and seven dogs . He was also honorary mayor of the town and commuted approximately 160 mi ( 260 km ) to Los Angeles every day when working for Ball . \n Gordon died of lung cancer on June 30 , 1995 , at the Redwood Terrace Health Center in Escondido , California , aged 89 . Virginia Curley , his wife of nearly 60 years , had died in the same facility one month earlier . The couple had no children . Gordon was survived by a sister . \n Born Charles Thomas Aldrich , Jr. , in New York City to vaudevillian Charles Thomas Aldrich and his wife , English actress Gloria Gordon , Gale Gordon 's first big radio break came via the recurring roles of `` Mayor La Trivia '' and `` Foggy Williams '' on Fibber McGee and Molly , before playing Rumson Bullard on the show 's successful spinoff , The Great Gildersleeve . Gordon and his character of Mayor La Trivia briefly left the show in December 1942 when Gordon enlisted in World War II and the storyline followed . He was the first actor to play the role of Flash Gordon , in the 1935 radio serial The Amazing Interplanetary Adventures of Flash Gordon . He also played Dr. Stevens in Glorious One . \n In 1958 , he appeared as a regular in the role of department store co-owner Bascomb Bleacher , Sr. , on the NBC sitcom Sally , starring Joan Caulfield and Marion Lorne . He also appeared on the Walter Brennan ABC sitcom , The Real McCoys . Gordon had a co-starring role in the CBS television comedy Pete and Gladys . At this time , he guest starred with Pat O'Brien in the ABC sitcom , Harrigan and Son , the story of a father - and - son lawyer team . He also appeared on the CBS / Desilu sitcom , Angel , with Annie Fargé . On The Danny Thomas Show , he guest starred in seven episodes . In five , he played the landlord of the building where the Williams family lived . In 1962 , Gordon appeared as different characters on two episodes of another ABC sitcom , The Donna Reed Show . \n Gale Gordon : From Mayor of Wistful Vista to Borrego Springs , by Jim Manago , published by BearManor Media in 2016 , is the first biography of Gordon .",

    "context": "The series begins after Marcy Bradford ( played by Emma Samms in the second - season episode `` In Her Dreams '' ) , the mother of 12 - year - old Nicole Bradford ( Keanan ) , has died . The two men who had competed for Marcy 's affections in Key West during the summer of 1974 - Michael Taylor ( Reiser ) , a successful financial advisor ; and struggling artist , Joey Harris ( Evigan ) , former friends who grew to hate one another over their mutual interest in the woman - are awarded joint custody of Nicole . \n The show returned in January 2017 , airing on both Antenna TV and Up . \n The series regularly featured Giovanni Ribisi and Chad Allen as two boys ( Cory Kupkus and Zach Nichols , respectively ) who competed for Nicole 's affections , just as her two dads had done for her mother 's . Florence Stanley appeared as Judge Margaret Wilbur , who was responsible for assigning Nicole 's custody , and who regularly looked over the family ; she was also their landlady , being the resident owner of the apartment building where the family lived . Amy Hathaway played Nicole 's worldly best friend , Shelby Haskell . The cast was rounded out by former football player Dick Butkus , who managed the cafe on the building 's first floor . The cafe ( Klawicki 's ) was the second spot in the show around which a plot usually revolved ; the first being the family 's apartment . In the third season , when Dick Butkus left the series , the diner was then run by cook Julian ( Don Yesso ) , but there was no explanation as to what happened to Ed Klawicki . Ownership of the diner was explained to have been taken over by Judge Wilbur at this point , and it was renamed The Judge 's Court Cafe . \n Each week , the mix - ups and trials of two single men raising a teenage daughter provide the stories . Judge Margaret W. Wilbur ( Florence Stanley ) , a family court judge who gave custody of Nicole to Michael and Joey , frequently visits the new family . She bought the building in which Joey lived , so is now the live - in landlord . Michael originally has his own condo uptown , but in Episode 2 , Nicole stages a sit in at school because she feels she had no home , and the men decide it is better to all live in one home . They choose Joey 's loft . \n The series comes to an end ( in the episode called `` See You in September ? '' ) when Joey reconnects with a former girlfriend named Sarah , and eventually moves to San Francisco to live with her and her daughter , Grace . He keeps in contact with Nicole , Michael and Judge Wilbur , all of whom remain in New York . Nicole writes a letter to Joey , in which she makes reference to going out to San Francisco to visit , and she ends by saying that no matter what , or where he is , or who he is with , she would always be happy with him as one of her two dads . \n My Two Dads had crossovers with another NBC show , Night Court . Judge Margaret W. Wilbur , played by Florence Stanley , appeared on Night Court . In turn , Richard Moll guest starred as his Night Court character Bull Shannon in the My Two Dads episode `` Playing with Fire '' , protecting Judge Wilbur from a recently released criminal that she had sent to prison years before . \n Mill Creek Entertainment released a 10 episode best - of set entitled My Two Dads - You Can Count on Me on March 22 , 2011 . The single disc release features episodes from the first 2 seasons . \n Nicole 's actual paternity is never revealed on the show , but in the episode `` Pop , the Question '' , Michael and Joey -- after a falling out -- have a DNA test to determine which of them is Nicole 's biological father . The test is conducted against Nicole 's wishes , she is happier not knowing who her true father is , and she destroys the results before opening them . Michael and Joey later resolve their differences and reconcile . Judge Wilbur looks at the results , but throws them away without revealing them to the audience . \n Shout ! Factory ( under license from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment ) has released the first two seasons of My Two Dads on DVD in Region 1 . Season 2 was released as a Shout ! Factory Exclusives title , available exclusively through their online store . \n My Two Dads is an American sitcom that was produced by Michael Jacobs Productions in association with Tri-Star Television ( later Columbia Pictures Television ) and distributed by TeleVentures .

'' Beth finally believes Nick and kisses him . The Priest had earlier won the poker chip from Nick and had dropped it in the fountain . Which would explain why the Priest was tying himself in knots while trying to marry Beth to Nick \n When Beth hands back the coins to Antonio , Lance , Gale , and Al , it is a parody of The Wizard of Oz , and Beth represents the Wizard giving each one something . Beth tells Gale that she will miss him `` least of all '' . The line is a reversal of what Dorothy Gale says to the Scarecrow ( `` I 'll miss you most of all '' ) when she bids goodbye to him near the end of the film . \n The plot of the film is the reverse of the 1954 film Three Coins in the Fountain about women in Rome who throw coins in a fountain and find love . \n The telephone call scene features the song `` I Am Changing '' by the Los Angeles band Mafia Bianca LLC , written and produced by Simone Sello and Steven Heinstein . \n When in Rome was released June 15 , 2010 , on DVD and Blu - ray Disc . \n Joan calls Beth on the day of a gala and tells her that the spell can also be broken by returning the coins to the original owner .

'' Slightly drunk and jealous at seeing Nick with another woman , she picks up coins ( a poker chip , a rare coin , a penny , a trick quarter and a Euro ) from the `` fountain of love '' ( probably based on the Trevi Fountain ) . Joan tells her that legend says if you take coins from the fountain , the owner of the coin will fall in love with you . \n When Beth 's suitors all show up together at her apartment , she tells them she does not love them and plans to return their coins . She also tells them of her love for Nick , but realizes that Stacey has stolen the coins . She sets off to retrieve the coins , aided by her suitors . All pile into a yellow Vespa 400 microcar ( featured on the movie poster ) , which careens through city traffic , into the Guggenheim and up an elevator . \n On Beth and Nick 's wedding day in Rome , Lance tells her he had several poker chips , and Nick did not break out of the spell . While exchanging wedding vows , Beth hesitates and dashes out of the church . She revisits the fountain and wades in again . \n It is one of the films most shown by the Brazilian film program Sessão da Tarde since 2012 , with its re-release airing between one and two months . \n The film was released on January 29 , 2010 , and opened at # 3 with $12,350,041 in United States and Canada behind Avatar and Edge of Darkness .

The film grossed $32,680,633 domestically , $10,362,202 foreign and $43,042,835 worldwide . \n The film has received negative reviews from critics . Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 16 % of critics gave the film positive reviews based on 109 reviews with an average score of 3.4 / 10 . The consensus states that `` A pair of young , attractive leads ca n't overcome When in Rome 's reliance on unfunny gags and threadbare rom - com clichés . '' Review aggregator , Metacritic , which assigns a weighted average of 0 -- 100 of the top reviews from mainstream critics , gave the film a `` generally unfavorable '' score of 25 % from 24 reviews . \n Beth is pursued back in New York City by a band of aggressive suitors whose coins she gathered , including a diminutive sausage magnate Al ( Danny DeVito ) , lanky street illusionist Lance ( Jon Heder ) , a doting painter Antonio ( Will Arnett ) , and a narcissistic male model Gale ( Dax Shepard ) . She must return the coins to the fountain to break the spell . As she falls in love with Nick , she realizes that the poker chip belongs to him and is convinced that he is under a spell , not truly in love with her . \n Successful and single Beth ( Kristen Bell ) , an art curator at the Guggenheim , is at a point in her life where love seems like a luxury she ca n't afford . Waiting for the `` perfect '' romance has embittered her . After flying to Rome to attend her younger sister Joan 's ( Alexis Dziena ) impulsive wedding , she meets Nicholas Beamon ( Josh Duhamel ) . He rescues her in a couple of difficult situations but they are both clumsy . Still , they hit it off . \n Despite negative reviews , James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film a fair review of 2.5 / 4 stars , claiming , `` The saving grace of the otherwise generic product is that Bell 's vivacity and Duhamel 's rakish charm allow the viewer to root for them , even if sometimes that rooting goes so far as to wish the script would serve the couple better than it does . '' \n Stacey returns the coins and Beth gives them back to their respective owners . Left with the poker chip , she calls Nick and thanks him for making her believe in love again . Nick makes his way to the gala to search for Beth in a sudden lightning storm that hits New York . There he happens to pick up his poker chip , dropped by Beth , and convinces her his love was true .",

The tunnel will also shorten the distance by about 50 km ( 31 mi ) and reduce the travel time between the southern and northern faces of Rohtang pass by five hours . While it now takes 4 to 6 hours to ascend , negotiate and descend the Rohtang pass , it will take only about 30 minutes to travel through the Rohtang tunnel . \n The pass provides a natural divide between the Kullu Valley with a primarily Hindu culture ( in the south ) , and the arid high - altitude Lahaul and Spiti valleys with a Buddhist culture ( in the north ) . The pass lies on the watershed between the Chenab and Beas basins . On the southern side of this pass , the Beas River emerges from underground and flows southward and on its northern side , the Chandra River ( flows from the eastern Himalayas ) , a source stream of the river Chenab , flows westward . \n The pass was featured on the Top Gear : India Special . \n This pass is an ancient trade route between the people on either side of Pir Panjal . The local name for this pass is a generic name of pass . There are many other passes in Lahaul and Spiti which have specific names ( Kunzam La , Baralacha La , etc . ) . This is suggestive of the fact that this must have been the oldest and most frequented pass in the region , or the fact that it is the main pass leading from one cultural region to another , quite different one , to the north . \n Sometimes travelling to rothang pass is difficult , so there is a need for ropeway . Government is stressing on to setup ropeway between kothi village which is in manali and rothang pass . Ropeway reduces the number of tourist vehicles which reduces a lot of traffic in the way to rothang pass. The NGT ( National Green Tribunal ) has asked the state government of manali to complete all the formalities to start ropeway .

    "context": "When McLaughlin began shipping his product to New York , it became so popular that he opened a plant in Manhattan shortly thereafter . After McLaughlin 's death in 1914 , the company was run briefly by his brother , Samuel McLaughlin . P.D. Saylor and Associates bought the business from the McLaughlin family in 1923 and formed Canada Dry Ginger Ale , Inc. , a public company . \n The `` Dry '' in the brand 's name refers to not being sweet , as in a dry wine . When John J. McLaughlin , who first formulated `` Canada Dry Pale Ginger Ale '' , originally made his new soft drink , it was far less sweet than other ginger ales then available ; as a result , he labelled it `` dry '' . \n Nylon Studios produced the song used in the Rabbit 's `` Jack 's Farm '' commercial featuring Canada Dry Ginger Ale . A Cantonese version of the ad was also produced . \n Brands with limited availability in the United States include : \n In 1890 , Canadian pharmacist and chemist John J. McLaughlin of Enniskillen , Ontario , after working in a soda factory in Brooklyn , New York , opened a carbonated water plant in Toronto . McLaughlin was the eldest son of Robert McLaughlin , founder of McLaughlin Carriage and McLaughlin Motor Car . In 1904 , McLaughlin created `` Canada Dry Pale Ginger Ale '' . Three years later , the drink was appointed to the Viceregal Household of the Governor General of Canada , and the label featuring a beaver atop a map of Canada was replaced with the present Crown and shield . \n Canada Dry is a brand of soft drinks owned since 2008 by the American Dr Pepper Snapple Group . For over a century , Canada Dry has been known for its ginger ale , though the company also manufactures a number of other soft drinks and mixers . Although Canada Dry originated in Canada , it is now produced in many countries around the globe , including the United States , Iran , Mexico , Colombia , Peru , the Middle East , Europe and Japan . \n Limited availability flavors are produced in Pennsauken Township , New Jersey , by Pepsi - Cola / National Brand Beverages and are distributed in southern New Jersey , Delaware , southeastern Pennsylvania , and eastern Maryland . At one time , the flavors all had uniquely designed labels ; but now all use the standard Canada Dry crest logo . \n Norton Simon took an interest in the company in 1964 , and it merged with Simon 's other holdings , the McCall Corporation and Hunt Foods , to form Norton Simon Inc . Dr Pepper bought Canada Dry from Norton Simon in 1982 . In 1984 , Dr Pepper was acquired by Forstmann Little & Company , and Canada Dry was sold to R.J. Reynolds ' Del Monte Foods unit to pay off acquisition debt . RJR Nabisco sold its soft drink business to Cadbury Schweppes in 1986 . Today , Canada Dry is owned by Dr Pepper Snapple Group , which was spun off from Cadbury Schweppes in 2008 . \n Canada Dry 's popularity as a mixer began during Prohibition , when its flavor helped mask the taste of homemade liquor . In the 1930s , Canada Dry expanded worldwide . From the 1950s onward , the company introduced a larger number of products .",

    "context": "The Assyrian captivity ( or the Assyrian exile ) is the period in the history of Ancient Israel and Judah during which several thousand Israelites of ancient Samaria were resettled as captives by Assyria . The Northern Kingdom of Israel was conquered by the Neo-Assyrian monarchs , Tiglath - Pileser III ( Pul ) and Shalmaneser V . The later Assyrian rulers Sargon II and his son and successor , Sennacherib , were responsible for finishing the twenty - year demise of Israel 's northern ten - tribe kingdom , although they did not overtake the Southern Kingdom . Jerusalem was besieged , but not taken . The tribes forcibly resettled by Assyria later became known as the Ten Lost Tribes . \n And all the congregation of Judah , with the priests and the Levites , and all the congregation that came out of Israel , and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel , and that dwelt in Judah , rejoiced . So there was great joy in Jerusalem ; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem . ( 2 Chronicles 30 : 25 -- 26 ) \n And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah , and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh , that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem , to keep the passover unto the LORD , the God of Israel . ( 2 Chronicles 30 : 1 ) \n In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria , and he took Ijon , and Abelbethmaachah , and Janoah , and Kedesh , and Hazor , and Gilead , and Galilee , all the land of Naphtali , and carried them captive to Assyria. ( 2 Kings 15 : 29 ) \n So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh , even unto Zebulun ; but they laughed them to scorn , and mocked them . Nevertheless certain men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves , and came to Jerusalem . ( 2 Chronicles 30 : 11 -- 12 ) \n For a multitude of the people , even many of Ephraim and Manasseh , Issachar and Zebulun , had not cleansed themselves , yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it is written . For Hezekiah had prayed for them , saying : ' The good LORD pardon ... ' ( 2 Chronicles 30 : 18 ) \n And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria , and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria , and he carried them away , even the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and the half tribe of Manasseh , and brought them unto Halah , and Habor , and Hara , and to the river Gozan , unto this day . ( 1 Chronicles 5 : 26 ) \n And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea : for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt , and brought no present to the king of Assyria , as he had done year by year : therefore the king of Assyria shut him up , and bound him in prison . Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land , and went up to Samaria , and besieged it three years . \n In 722 BCE , nearly ten to twenty years after the initial deportations , the ruling city of the Northern Kingdom of Israel , Samaria , was finally taken by Sargon II after a three - year siege started by Shalmaneser V . \n Fifty chariots for my royal equipment I selected . The city I rebuilt . I made it greater than it was before . \n However , it has also been suggested that the numbers deported by the Assyrians were rather limited and the bulk of the population remained in situ . There is also evidence that significant numbers fled south to the Kingdom of Judah . \n And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah , and of the children of Benjamin , and of the children of Ephraim and Manasseh . This particular verse is often misconstrued , since the obvious declaration being made in 1 Chronicles 9 : 1 are that of a genealogical reference . The clear indication is seen when directing the readers attention to 1 Chronicles 9 : 2 when mentioning the Nethinims of which were a people conquered by Joshua ( Joshua 9 : 27 . This thereby dictates that it 's referring to a completely different time and era , as further seen with the description in verse 2 where it indicates that the Israelites were gaining their land - designated possessions attributed to their God YHWH and his General in charge Joshua . ( 1 Chronicles 9 : 3 ) \n And when Asa heard these words , even the prophecy of Oded the prophet , he took courage , and put away the detestable things out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin , and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill - country of Ephraim ; and he renewed the altar of the LORD , that was before the porch of the LORD . \n Now when all this was finished , all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah , and broke in pieces the pillars , and hewed down the Asherim , and broke down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin , in Ephraim also and Manasseh , until they had destroyed them all . Then all the children of Israel returned , every man to his possession , into their own cities . ( 2 Chronicles 31 : 1 ) \n The scriptures of the titled `` Old Testament '' are not accurately complete without the records of those Hebrew writers that penned them . This points to the complete records that declare the clarity of the Grecian conquests of the Judeans during and after the reign of Alexander , as indicated by the book of Maccabbees . The historical accuracy by the prophet Ezra is complete only when the details of the Apocrypha 's 1st and 2nd Esdras are referenced , since there is where the complete history of the dispersion of the Northern Kingdom tribes is seen , in 2 Esdras 13 : 40 -- 48 . \n Sargon records his first campaign on the walls of the royal palace at Dur - Sharrukin ( Khorsabad ) : \n According to the Books of Chronicles chapter 9 line 3 , the Israelites , who took part in The Return to Zion , are stated to be from the Tribe of Judah alongside the Tribe of Simeon that was absorbed into it , the Tribe of Benjamin , the Tribe of Levi ( Levites and Priests ) alongside the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh , which according to the Book of Kings 2 Chapter 7 were supposedly exiled by the Assyrians ( The Biblical scholars Umberto Cassuto and Elia Samuele Artom claimed these two tribes ' names to be a reference to the remant of all Ten Tribes that was not exiled and absorbed into the Judean population ) . \n In my first year of reign * * * the people of Samaria * * * to the number of 27,290 ... I carried away . \n And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin , and them that sojourned with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh , and out of Simeon ; for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance , when they saw that the LORD his God was with him . \n Some estimates assume a captivity numbering in the hundreds of thousands , minus those who died in defense of the kingdom and minus those who fled voluntarily before and during the invasions . \n In 2nd Chronicles , Chapter 31 , it is said that the remnant of the Kingdom of Israel returned to their homes , but not before destroying Ba'al and Ashera places of Idol worship left in `` all Judah and Benjamin , in Ephraim also and Manasseh '' . \n Unlike the Kingdom of Judah , which was able to return from its Babylonian captivity , the ten tribes of the Northern Kingdom never had a foreign edict granting permission to return and rebuild their homeland . Many centuries later , rabbis of the restored Kingdom of Judah were still debating the return of the lost ten tribes . However , Assyria had been conquered by Babylon , and Babylon had been conquered by the Medo - Persians . \n Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria ; and Hoshea became his servant , and gave him presents . \n According to 2nd Chronicles , Chapter 30 , there is evidence that at least some people of the Northern Kingdom of Israel were not exiled . These were invited by king Hezekiah to keep the Passover in a feast at Jerusalem with the Judean population . ( The holiday was set one month forward from its original date . ) Hezekiah sent his posts to spread the word among the remnant of the Northern kingdom ; the posts were mocked during their visit to the country of Ephraim , Manasseh and Zebulun . However , some people of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem . In a later part of the chapter , even people from the Tribe of Issachar and the strangers that `` came out from the land of Israel '' were said to take part in the passover event . Biblical scholars such as Umberto Cassuto and Elia Samuele Artom claimed that Hezekiah might have annexed these territories , in which inhabitants of the Kingdom of Israel remained , into his own kingdom . \n So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah , according to the commandment of the king , saying : ' Ye children of Israel , turn back unto the LORD , the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , that He may return to the remnant that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria . And be ye not like your fathers and like your brethren who acted treacherously against the LORD , the God of their fathers , so that He delivered them to desolation , as ye see . Now be ye not stiffnecked as your fathers were , but yield yourselves unto the LORD and enter into His sanctuary which He hath sanctified for ever ; and serve the LORD your God that His fierce anger may turn away from you . \n The term `` cities of the Medes '' mentioned above may be a corruption from an original text `` Mountains of Media '' . \n The description of the final defeat of the Northern Kingdom of Israel above appears to be a minor event in Sargon 's legacy . Some historians attribute the ease of Israel 's defeat to the previous two decades of invasions , defeats , and deportations . \n And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes : because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God , but transgressed his covenant , and all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded and would not hear them , nor do them . ( 2 Kings 18 : 11 -- 12 ) \n So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel , from Beer - sheba even to Dan , that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD , the God of Israel , at Jerusalem ; for they had not kept it in great numbers accordingly , as it is written . \n The captivities began in approximately 740 BCE ( or 733 / 2 BCE according to other sources ) . \n Assyrian cuneiform states that 27,290 captives were taken from Samaria , the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel , by the hand of Sargon II . \n The Book of Kings states several times that the entire people of the Kingdom of Israel had been taken into exile by the Assyrians . Some believe that the Books of Chronicles information about the fate of the Northern Kingdom adds up differently . What is often cited is 2nd Chronicles , Chapter 15 , which mentions that there had been people from the hill - country cities of Ephraim and Manasseh who were captured by the Judean king , Asa of Judah . And Asa , sojourning among the Judean kingdom population , returned practicing the Hebrew belief . However , this is a mis - characterization of the events . Since those scriptures clearly declare that it was at a time when the Northern Kingdom was still intact , this happened in an era before the Assyrian Captivity .",

    "context": "How the world evolved into the three states is vague . They appear to have emerged from nuclear warfare and civil dissolution over 20 years between 1945 , the end of World War II , and 1965 . Eurasia was likely formed first , followed closely afterwards by Oceania , with Eastasia emerging a decade later , possibly in the 1960s . \n At one point during the novel , Julia procures tea to share with Winston and remarks that she thinks Oceania recently captured India ( or perhaps parts of India ) , but such `` control '' is usually transient . \n Almost all of the information about the world beyond London is given to the reader through government or Party sources , which , by the very premise of the novel , are unreliable narrators . Specifically , Julia brings up the idea in one page that the war is fictional and that the rocket bombs falling from time to time on London are fired by the government of Oceania itself to maintain the war atmosphere among the population . The protagonists have no means of proving or disproving the theory . However , during preparations for Hate Week , rocket bombs fall at an increasing rate , hitting places such as playgrounds and crowded theatres , causing mass casualties and increased hysteria and hatred for the Party 's enemies . War is also a convenient pretext to maintain a huge military -- industrial complex in which the state is committed to developing and acquiring large and expensive weapons systems , which almost immediately become obsolete and require replacement . Finally , according to Goldstein 's book , war makes handing over power to a small caste easier and gives a pretext to do so . \n Oceania 's national anthem is Oceania , Tis For Thee , which , in one of the three film versions of the book , takes the form of a crescendo of organ music along with operatic lyrics . The lyrics are sung in English , and the song is reminiscent of God Save the Queen and My Country , ' Tis of Thee . \n Eastasia and Eurasia fight over `` a large but fluctuating portion of Manchuria , Mongolia , and Tibet '' . \n Oceania , Eurasia and Eastasia are the three fictional superstates in George Orwell 's satirical dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty - Four . \n The `` disputed area '' , which lies `` between the frontiers of the super-states '' , is `` a rough quadrilateral with its corners at Tangier , Brazzaville , Darwin , and Hong Kong '' . This area is fought over during the perpetual war among the three superstates , one of which sometimes controls vast swaths of the disputed territory , only to lose it again . The reason that the three superstates seek to control the area is to harness the large population and the vast resources within the region . Control of the islands in the Pacific and the polar regions is also constantly shifting , but there also , none of the three superpowers ever gains a lasting hold . The inhabitants of the area , having no allegiance to any nation , live in constant slavery under whichever power controls them . \n The ruling doctrine of Oceania is Ingsoc , the Newspeak neologism for English Socialism . Its nominal leader is Big Brother , believed by the masses to have been the leader of the revolution and still used as an icon by the Party . The cult of personality is maintained through Big Brother 's function as a focal point for love , fear , and reverence , more easily felt towards an individual than towards an organization . \n The unofficial language of Oceania is English ( officially called Oldspeak ) , and the official language is Newspeak . The restructuring of the language is intended to eliminate unorthodox political and social thought by eliminating the words needed to express it . \n The world of Nineteen Eighty - Four exists in a state of perpetual war among the three major powers . Two of the three states are aligned against the third : Oceania and Eurasia against Eastasia or Eurasia and Eastasia against Oceania . However , as Goldstein 's book points out , each superstate is so powerful that even an alliance of the other two can not destroy it , which results in a continuing stalemate . From time to time , one of the states betrays its ally and sides with its former enemy . In Oceania , when that occurs , the Ministry of Truth rewrites history to make it appear that the current state of affairs is the way it has always been , and documents with contradictory information are destroyed in the memory hole . \n The society of Oceania is sharply stratified into three groups : the small ruling Inner Party , the more - numerous and highly - indoctrinated Outer Party , and the large body of politically - meaningless Proles . Apart from exceptions such as Hate Week , the proles remain essentially outside Oceania 's political control and are placated by trivial sports and other entertainment : the Thought Police manage any Proles who are socially aware enough to be a problem . \n It is stated that Eurasia was formed when the Soviet Union annexed the rest of Continental Europe , creating a single polity stretching from Portugal to the Bering Strait . Orwell frequently describes the face of the standard Eurasian as `` mongolic '' in the novel . The only soldiers other than Oceanians to appear in the novel are the Eurasians . When a large number of captured soldiers are executed in Victory Square , some Slavs are mentioned , but the stereotype of the Eurasian maintained by the Party is Mongoloid , like O'Brien 's servant , Martin . That implies that the Party uses racism to avert sympathy towards an enemy . \n Like the rest of Europe , Britain was hit by atomic weapons in the conflicts before the revolutions in Oceania and then elsewhere . One British town , Colchester , is referenced specifically as having been destroyed ; flashbacks to Smith 's childhood also include scenes of Londoners taking refuge in the London Underground tunnels in the midst of the bombing . \n Eastasia 's borders are not as clearly defined as those of the other two superstates , but it is known that they encompass most of modern - day China , Japan , Taiwan , and Korea . Eastasia repeatedly captures and loses Indonesia , New Guinea , and the various Pacific archipelagos . Its political ideology is , according to the novel , `` called by a Chinese name usually translated as Death - worship , but perhaps better rendered as ' Obliteration of the Self ' '' . Orwell does not appear to have based this on any existing Chinese word or phrase . \n Goldstein 's book states that the war is not a war in the traditional sense but simply exists to use up resources and keep the population in line . Victory for any side is not attainable or even desirable , but the Inner Party , through an act of doublethink , believes that such victory is possible . Although the war began with the limited use of atomic weapons in a limited atomic war in the 1950s , the combatants all stopped using them for fear of upsetting the balance of power . Relatively few technological advances have been made ( the only two mentioned are the replacement of bombers with `` rocket bombs '' and of traditional capital ships with the immense `` floating fortresses '' ) . Examples of both technologies had been developed in the closing stages of World War II : the V2 rocket , the ice aircraft carrier , and the floating harbour . \n Not much information about Eastasia is given in the book . It is known that it is the newest and smallest of the three superstates . According to Goldstein 's book , it emerged a decade after the establishment of the other two superstates , placing it somewhere in the 1960s , after years of `` confused fighting '' among its predecessor nations . ( At the time of writing , the victory of Mao Zedong 's Communists in the Chinese Civil War was not yet taken as a foregone conclusion . The Korean War had also not yet occurred , but Korea was already being administered by two competing governments . Japan was still under military occupation by several different powers , at least until shortly before Orwell completed the book . Power in the real - life nations that make up the fictional Eastasia was , therefore , very much in flux . ) It is also said in the book that the industriousness and the fecundity of the people of Eastasia allow them to overcome their territorial inadequacy in comparison to the other two powers . At the time Orwell wrote the book , East Asians , including the Japanese , all had birth rates higher than those of Europeans . \n Even the names of countries , and their shapes on the map , had been different . Airstrip One , for instance , had not been so called in those days : it had been called England , or Britain , though London , he felt fairly certain , had always been called London . \n Oceania is the superstate in which protagonist Winston Smith dwells . It is believed to be composed of the Americas , the British Isles ( called `` Airstrip One '' in the novel ) , Iceland , Australia , New Zealand , Polynesia , and Southern Africa below the River Congo . It also controls , to different degrees and at various times during the course of its perpetual war with either Eurasia or Eastasia , the polar regions , India , Indonesia , and the islands of the Pacific . Oceania lacks a single capital city , but London and apparently New York City may be regional capitals . In the novel , Emmanuel Goldstein , Oceania 's declared public enemy number one , describes it in the fictional book The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism as a result of the United States having absorbed the British Empire . Goldstein 's book also states that Oceania 's primary natural defence is the sea surrounding it . \n According to Goldstein 's book , Eurasia 's main natural defence is its vast territorial extent , while the ruling ideology of Eurasia is identified as `` Neo-Bolshevism '' , a variation of the Oceanian `` Ingsoc '' .",

    "context": "Tide is marketed under various sub-brands , such as 2x Ultra Tide . In the late 1960s and early 1970s , it was branded as Tide XK ( the XK standing for Xtra Kleaning ) , but it was rebranded simply as Tide later . \n Tide has also sponsored a few things like NASCAR stock cars , notably as the `` Tide Ride '' . Darrell Waltrip drove the # 17 Tide - sponsored Chevy for Hendrick Motorsports . The relationship lasted from 1987 to 1990 and won the 1989 Daytona 500 along the way . Waltrip left the team to form his own team . Tide then sponsored Ricky Rudd in the # 5 car after Levi Garrett left Hendrick . Rudd drove for Hendrick until 1993 , when he left the racing team , also to form his own team and taking the Tide sponsorship . Rudd Performance Motorsports ran from 1994 -- 1999 and won the 4th Brickyard 400 in 1997 . After Rudd became winless in his first time in 17 seasons , Tide left Rudd after being lured by Calvin Well 's new team PPI Motorsports . The new team 's number was 32 , which was a combination of 17 , 5 , and 10 added all up . Scott Pruett was the first driver but after DNQing 6 times and no Top 10s . Ricky Craven took over in 2001 and responded with a win at Martinsville Speedway . He went winless in 2002 , but one year later , he won the closest race in NASCAR history at Darlington in the Carolina Dodge Dealers 400 , rubbing with Kurt Busch for laps and with a margin - of - victory of 0.002 . It is tied for the closest finish in Cup Series history . After no Top 10s halfway through the 2004 season , Craven left PPI and was replaced by Bobby Hamilton , Jr. for 2004 and 2005 . Travis Kvapil ran for PPI in 2006 but with four DNQ 's . Tide left the sport before it was going to sponsor one of Well 's proposed Toyota teams in 2007 . Tide was on Kevin Harvick 's truck a few times , but Kroger was promoting the car with it . Tide made its Cup series return in September 2016 , when it sponsored Matt Kenseth 's No. 20 car for a Darlington tribute scheme . Tide extended their sponsorship to Joe Gibbs Racing to three races in 2017 . \n Tide is sold in the UK as Daz Go - Pods ; they have the marking `` Daz / Vizir / Tide '' on the back and bear the same distinctive design . \n Tide is a laundry detergent introduced in 1946 and manufactured by American multinational Procter & Gamble . \n In some areas , Tide has become such a hot commodity item , that criminals steal it from stores to resell . Police call the detergent `` liquid gold '' on the black market and it has been known to be traded or sold for illegal drugs . \n The original Tide laundry detergent was a synthetic designed specifically for heavy - duty , machine cleaning ( an advance over the milder cleaning capabilities of FeWA and Dreft ) . Tide was first introduced in U.S. test markets in 1946 as the world 's first heavy - duty detergent , with nationwide distribution accomplished in 1949 . Tide claimed it was `` America 's Washday Favorite . '' Authority was quickly gained in the U.S. detergent market , dwarfing the sales of Ivory Snow ; and accelerating the demise of two of its main competing products , Rinso and Gold Dust Washing Powder , both then Lever Brothers brands . These other brands came in the more familiar soap - powder and soap - flake forms . Tide , however , came shaped as a white powdered bead . The line was expanded to include an orange - tinted clear liquid form in 1984 . Today , most formulations of liquid Tide , both concentrated and regular , are dark blue , with the exception of `` Tide Free '' , which is clear . Each year , Tide researchers duplicate the mineral content of water from all parts of the United States and wash 50,000 loads of laundry to test Tide detergent 's consistency and performance . \n The household chore of doing the laundry began to change with the introduction of washing powders in the 1880s . These new laundry products were pulverized soap . New cleaning - product marketing successes , such as the 1890s introduction of the N.K. Fairbank Company 's Gold Dust Washing Powder ( which used a breakthrough hydrogenation process in its formulation ) , and Hudson 's heavily advertised product , Rinso , proved that there was a ready market for better cleaning agents . Henkel & Cie 's `` self - activating '' ( or self bleaching ) cleaner , Persil ; ( introduced in 1907 ) ; the early synthetic detergent , BASF 's Fewa ( introduced in 1932 ) ; and Procter & Gamble 's 1933 totally synthetic creation , Dreft ( marketed for use on infant - wear ) -- all indicated significant advances in the laundry cleaning product market . \n In Puerto Rico and elsewhere in Latin America , the Tide formula is marketed under the name Ace ( except in Ecuador and Panama , where it is sold under the same Tide brand as is in current use in the U.S. ) In Turkey , Tide is branded as Alo . In Poland , it is sold as Vizir . In Hong Kong , Malaysia and Singapore , it is sold as Fab , a brand acquired in 2006 from Colgate - Palmolive . \n Since 2012 , Tide has sold laundry detergent pods , making an estimated 15 % of market sales . In late 2017 , an Internet meme was popularized around the concept of eating Tide Pods and , as a result , many YouTubers attempted the extremely dangerous `` Tide Pod Challenge . '' \n An addition to the Tide family , Tide Coldwater was formulated to remove stains while saving energy because it does not require hot or even warm water . Tide Free is marketed as being free from dyes or perfumes . Tide - To - Go is a product packaged in a pen - like format and intended to remove small stains on the spot , without further laundering . \n The Tide brand is on at least six powders and liquid detergents in the United States . \n As of January 2013 Tide has more than 30 % of the liquid - detergent market , with more than twice as much in sales as the second most - popular brand Gain , although it costs about 50 % more than the average liquid detergent . \n In 2006 , the development of Tide was designated an ACS National Historic Chemical Landmark in recognition of its significance as the first heavy - duty synthetic detergent . \n Tide was the first product to be nationally packaged using Day - Glo colors -- strikingly eye - catching when first introduced in 1959 . \n The detergent business was further revolutionized with the discovery of the alkylbenzene sulfonates , which , when combined with the use of chemical `` builders '' , made machine washing with hard water possible . This presented Procter and Gamble with the opportunity to create a product such as Tide . \n In a 2009 survey , consumers ranked Tide among the three brands they would be least likely to give up during the Great Recession . The Tide trademark is an easily recognized , distinctive orange - and - yellow bulls - eye . This original logo was designed by Donald Deskey , an architect and famous industrial designer . The logo was slightly modified for the product 's fiftieth anniversary in 1996 , and remains in use today .",

    "context": "Knotts personally called the Bon Ami company president to get permission to mention the cleaning product 's name in one of the film 's running gags . \n Outside the mansion , alone and dejected , Luther begins to walk home . However , he hears the old organ playing the creepy music again . Courageously , he re-enters the mansion and discovers his friend , Mr. Kelsey ( Liam Redmond ) , the newspaper 's janitor , playing the organ . Kelsey , the former gardener for the Simmons family , confesses to being responsible for the mysterious happenings Heggs witnessed ( including playing the organ remotely from an additional `` tuning '' keyboard located under the pipes ) . He tells Luther that Herkie , the overzealous police officer and acting security guard , kept him from entering the house earlier to help Luther confirm his story for the judge , jury and interested parties . Upon hearing a scream , they both descend the secret staircase to find Nicholas Simmons holding Alma captive . Kelsey confronts Simmons for killing his aunt and uncle for their fortune and leaving Kelsey 's pruning shears behind to frame him ( Kelsey had removed them before the police arrived to avoid being implicated in the murder ) . Nicholas Simmons ' planned demolition of the house was an effort to destroy the hidden staircase that would ruin his alibi . Luther rescues Alma by knocking Simmons unconscious with a full body lunge ( `` made my whole body a weapon '' ) from behind . \n On July 12 , 2005 , Percepto released the soundtrack on Compact Disc . Composer Vic Mizzy used the old tune Mr. Ghost Goes to Town as his main theme . Mizzy 's haunted house organ theme also appeared in the film Games ( 1967 ) . \n The Mr. Chicken mansion is actually not the Munster house , although they are next door to each other on the new Colonial street , with the Munster house on the right . Originally they were on the old Colonial street , near New York street and Courthouse square , with the Munster house to the left of the Mr. Chicken mansion , and that is where this movie was filmed . \n To increase newspaper sales , Luther is assigned to spend the night in the house on the 20th anniversary of the murder / suicide . At midnight , Heggs sees the old organ begin to play by itself . There are a few other mysterious happenings , including Luther 's discovery of a secret staircase to the organ loft , hidden behind a sliding bookshelf , and a pair of gardener 's shears in the throat of a painting of Mrs. Simmons . His eerie story gets the town abuzz and causes a delay in the plans of Nicholas Simmons ( Philip Ober ) , nephew of the deceased couple , who intends to demolish the mansion . In retaliation , and to discredit Heggs , Simmons sues both Heggs and the Rachel Courier Express for libel . \n * Harry Hickox played the anvil salesman in The Music Man feature film . He is also credited as Harold Hill in the touring production of the stage play version . \n Nicholas Simmons is arrested and tied to a chair . Kelsey explains the details to the police chief and other persons ( who have now returned to the mansion ) , and the case is closed . Alma takes Luther 's hand , grateful for his heroic act in saving her . In the final scene , Heggs marries Alma at a small ceremony . At the end , the wedding 's organ music suddenly changes to the spooky organ music of the Simmons ' mansion . Everyone turns to see the small organ 's keys moving by themselves , hinting that there really is a ghost after all . \n The original cut of the film included a scene where the portrait stabbing was explained . Kelsey had printed a copy of the portrait and placed on the back side of the one on the landing of the staircase . When pressing a secret button , the portrait turned to reveal the shears stuck in the throat with red paint . This scene was cut from all other prints and has only been seen a few times in theaters and on some television showings . \n This film was produced by Universal Studios , which produced countless classic horror films . Knotts was best known at the time of the film 's production for his Emmy Award - winning five seasons on the sitcom The Andy Griffith Show as small town deputy sheriff Barney Fife . Andy Griffith , Knotts ' co-star on The Andy Griffith Show , suggested expanding on an episode from the television series involving a deserted house ( the old Rimshaw house in the episode `` Haunted House '' aired October 1963 ) in which Barney , Gomer , and Andy retrieve a baseball of Opie and his friend from the house . Another Andy Griffith Show connection is a small role played by Hal Smith , who had a recurring role on the show . Knotts left the television series at the end of the 1964 -- 65 season in order to pursue a film career . He had already starred in The Incredible Mr. Limpet ( 1964 ) . Knotts ' popularity prompted a multiple - movie deal with Universal , starting with this movie , and followed by The Reluctant Astronaut ( 1967 ) , The Shakiest Gun in the West ( 1968 ) , The Love God ( 1969 ) and How to Frame a Figg ( 1971 ) . The Ghost and Mr. Chicken was directed by Alan Rafkin with a screenplay by Jim Fritzell and Everett Greenbaum ; all three men had been associated with the success of The Andy Griffith Show . Several players from the television series also appear in the film including Lurene Tuttle , Burt Mustin , Hal Smith and Hope Summers . Viewers will also recognize several actors and actresses who had appeared or were then appearing on other sitcoms of the time . The movie boasts one of the largest collection of character actors / actresses assembled in a single movie . \n Luther Heggs ( Don Knotts ) is a typesetter at the Rachel Courier Express ( the local newspaper in Rachel , Kansas ) , but he aspires to be a reporter . One night , observing what he believes to be a murder outside of an old , supposedly haunted house known as the Simmons Mansion , Heggs rushes to the police station with his scoop . Unfortunately , as he relates the details of his story to the Chief of Police , the murder `` victim '' walks into the room , a local drunk who had merely been knocked unconscious by his irate wife , who had brought him in to be jailed . The next morning , Heggs walks downstairs to the dining room at the Natalie Miller boarding house and overhears Ollie Weaver ( Skip Homeier ) , a full - time reporter at the newspaper , mocking Luther 's mistakes of the night before . Ollie is also dating Heggs ' eventual love interest , Alma Parker ( Joan Staley ) . According to local lore , the Simmons Mansion was a `` murder house '' 20 years earlier , when Mr. Simmons murdered his wife ( with some unknown sharp instrument that was never located -- ultimately revealed to be a pair of gardener 's pruning shears ) , and then jumped to his death from the organ loft . Legend has it that the ghost of Mr. Simmons can still occasionally be heard playing the organ at midnight . \n The Ghost and Mr. Chicken is a 1966 American comedy - drama film starring Don Knotts as Luther Heggs , a newspaper typesetter who spends a night in a haunted house , which is located in the fictitious community of Rachel , Kansas . The working title was Running Scared . The title is presumably a humorous variation of the film The Ghost and Mrs. Muir ( 1947 ) . \n Universal contract star Joan Staley was known by Alan Rafkin from their work together on the sitcom Broadside . Normally a blonde , she had to wear a dark wig because the producers felt she was `` too sexy '' as a blonde ( she was actually Playboy 's `` Miss November '' 1958 , but was photographed very modestly , being only partially nude ) and the role called for a brunette . She wore the same wig previously worn by Claudia Cardinale in Blindfold ( 1966 ) . Al Checco , Knotts ' Army - days comedy partner , had an uncredited appearance in the film . \n The Ghost and Mr. Chicken was released on VHS on April 30 , 1996 . Universal released the film on DVD September 2 , 2003 and again on January 9 , 2007 , and on Blu - ray on October 4 , 2016 . \n The `` Simmons Mansion '' , a three - story Second - Empire Victorian house , stands on Colonial Street on the Universal Studios lot in California and was built for the film So Goes My Love ( 1946 ) . It appeared as the Dowd house in the film Harvey ( 1950 ) , and , with several alterations to the architecture , served as the home of Gabrielle Solis in Desperate Housewives ( 2004 - 2012 ) . But according to horror movie host Svengoolie ( aka Rich Koz , who featured The Ghost and Mr. Chicken in his 2012 - 2013 season on the ME TV broadcast network ) , the mansion was also the home of the Munsters . The popular but short - lived 1964 - 66 sitcom , and the related movie , Munster , Go Home ! ( 1966 ) , were both produced by Universal Studios . \n In the courtroom , Heggs ' credibility is impeached by damaging testimony from his grade school teacher ( Ellen Corby ) who testifies that Luther was `` keyed up '' as a child , prone to telling tall tales for attention . Luther 's own testimony is twisted by Simmons ' attorney , suggesting that Luther concocted the story about his spooky night in the mansion in order to win a job as a full - time reporter . Luther 's dramatic denial prompts the judge to order the jury and all interested parties to appear at the Simmons house at just before midnight to allow Heggs to prove his story . But with everyone now inside the mansion , nothing happens , and they conclude that Luther made up the whole story . Everyone leaves the mansion except for Alma , who lingers behind in secret , hoping to find evidence to restore Heggs ' reputation .",

A grateful Richard tells her to start writing a book about her experience . Sitting at her desk , she begins to write the story , entitled Brain on Fire . \n After consulting with a clinic , her father Tom ( Armitage ) confronts Stephen about not calling her parents regarding the incident . Tom suggests that she stay with her parents , which Susannah refuses to do , but in the end she leaves to stay with her mother and stepfather . At her mother 's house , Susannah has another seizure . She is taken to a clinic where Susannah undergoes an MRI . The doctor advises her mother , Rhona ( Moss ) , that Susannah has been partying too much , working too hard and not getting enough sleep . While at one of her doctor 's appointments , Susannah expresses she has bipolar disorder , since she is creative and `` creative people are bipolar '' . Another doctor prescribes an anti-psychotic medication which , after reading of their side effects and believing them as causing her symptoms , she refuses . Rhona gets her to take the pills anyway , and asks her father to watch her because she is too difficult to handle . During dinner with her father , she becomes violent , yelling at her father to stay away . Her parents demand that she is hospitalized despite MRI , EEG and physical tests all showing normal results . \n On May 1 , 2014 , Deadline reported that Charlize Theron had acquired the film rights to Susannah Cahalan 's 2012 memoir Brain on Fire : My Month of Madness .

Dix through her banner Denver and Delilah Productions . On January 22 , 2015 , Gerard Barrett was set to write and direct the adaptation , while Rob Merilees of Foundation Features would produce and finance the film . London - based Mister Smith Entertainment sold the film to international distributors at 2015 Berlin Film Festival . Will Poulter was added to the cast on February 4 , 2015 , to play Cahalan 's boyfriend .

On July 20 , 2015 , Tyler Perry joined the film to play Richard , Cahalan 's boss at the New York Post . \n One of the doctors says to her parents that she is possibly suffering from schizophrenia . The doctor tells them that if Susannah 's behavior does not improve , she will be transferred to another hospital , where they can deal with psychological problems . Susannah becomes catatonic , and Dr. Souhel Najjar is asked to help in investigating her case . Najjar has Susannah draw a clock . She draws it with all of the numbers ( 1 -- 12 ) on the right side of the clock , leading the doctor to believe that the right hemisphere of her brain is swollen and inflamed . Najjar has her undergo a brain biopsy in order to take cells from her brain for diagnosis . It is found that Susannah has anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and Najjar describes it to her parents and Stephen as her `` brain is on fire '' . Dr. Najjar prescribes her a treatment , which leads to a slow , but full recovery of her cognitive abilities . \n On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 13 % , based on 15 critics , and an average rating of 4.5 / 10 .

    "context": "In an attempt to improve the security of the SAM database against offline software cracking , Microsoft introduced the SYSKEY function in Windows NT 4.0 . When SYSKEY is enabled , the on - disk copy of the SAM file is partially encrypted , so that the password hash values for all local accounts stored in the SAM are encrypted with a key ( usually also referred to as the `` SYSKEY '' ) . It can be enabled by running the syskey program . \n Since a hash function is one - way , this provides some measure of security for the storage of the passwords . \n This software has both a highly pragmatic and beneficial use as a password clearing or account recovering utility for individuals who have lost or forgotten their Windows account passwords , as well as a possible use as a malicious software security bypassing utility . Essentially granting a user with enough ability , experience , and familiarity with both the cracking utility software and the security routines of the Windows NT kernel ( as well as offline and immediate local access to the target computer ) the capability to entirely bypass or remove the windows account passwords from a potential target computer . Only recently , Microsoft released a utility called LockSmith , which is part of MSDart . MSDart is not freely available to end - users , however . \n The Security Account Manager ( SAM ) , often Security Accounts Manager , is a database file in Windows XP , Windows Vista , Windows 7 , 8.1 and 10 that stores users ' passwords . It can be used to authenticate local and remote users . Beginning with Windows 2000 SP4 , Active Directory authenticates remote users . SAM uses cryptographic measures to prevent unauthenticated users accessing the system . \n In Windows NT 3.51 , NT 4.0 and 2000 , an attack was devised to bypass the local authentication system . If the SAM file is deleted from the hard drive ( e.g. mounting the Windows OS volume into an alternate operating system ) , the attacker could log in as any account with no password . This flaw was corrected with Windows XP , which shows an error message and shuts down the computer . However , there exist software utilities , which , by the aforementioned methodology of using either an emulated virtual drive , or boot disk ( usually Unix / Linux , or another copy of Windows like Windows Preinstallation Environment ) based environment to mount the local drive housing the active NTFS partition , and using programmed software routines and function calls from within assigned memory stacks to isolate the SAM file from the Windows NT system installation directory structure ( default : % SystemRoot % / system32 / config / SAM ) and , depending on the particular software utility being used , removes the password hashes stored for user accounts in their entirety , or in some cases , modify the user account passwords directly from this environment . \n This article is based on material taken from the Free On - line Dictionary of Computing prior to 1 November 2008 and incorporated under the `` relicensing '' terms of the GFDL , version 1.3 or later . \n LM hash is a compromised protocol and has been replaced by NTLM hash . Most versions of Windows can be configured to disable the creation and storage of valid LM hashes when the user changes their password . Windows Vista and later versions of Windows disable LM hash by default . Note : enabling this setting does not immediately clear the LM hash values from the SAM , but rather enables an additional check during password change operations that will instead store a `` dummy '' value in the location in the SAM database where the LM hash is otherwise stored . ( This dummy value has no relationship to the user 's password - it is the same value used for all user accounts . ) \n In the case of online attacks , it is not possible to simply copy the SAM file to another location . The SAM file can not be moved or copied while Windows is running , since the Windows kernel obtains and keeps an exclusive filesystem lock on the SAM file , and will not release that lock until the operating system has shut down or a `` Blue Screen of Death '' exception has been thrown . However , the in - memory copy of the contents of the SAM can be dumped using various techniques ( including pwdump ) , making the password hashes available for offline brute - force attack . \n The user passwords are stored in a hashed format in a registry hive either as a LM hash or as a NTLM hash . This file can be found in % SystemRoot % / system32 / config / SAM and is mounted on HKLM / SAM .",

    "context": "In 1977 , the McDonald 's restaurant owner clients who regularly met with Bernstein were looking for ways to create a better experience for families with kids . Bernstein reasoned that if kids could get a packaged meal all their own instead of just picking at their parent 's food , everybody would be happier . He had often noticed his young son at the breakfast table poring over the various items on cereal boxes and thought , `` Why not do that for McDonald 's ? The package is the key ! '' He then called in his creative team and had them mock up some paperboard boxes fashioned to resemble lunch pails with the McDonald 's Golden Arches for handles . They called in nationally known children 's illustrators and offered them the blank slate of filling the box 's sides and tops with their own colorful ideas from art to jokes to games to comic strips to stories to fantasy : whatever they thought might appeal to kids , at least 8 items per box . Inside the box would be a burger , small fries , packet of cookies and a surprise gift . A small drink would accompany these items . Bernstein named it The Happy Meal and it was successfully introduced with television and radio spots and in - store posters in the Kansas City market in October 1977 . Other markets followed and the national roll - out happened in 1979 . \n On November 2 , 2010 , the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a law requiring that children 's meals sold in restaurants must meet certain nutritional standards before they could be sold with toys , to reduce triggering of childhood obesity . The law , urged in part by an increase of childhood obesity in the United States , would allow toys to be included with children 's meals that have less than 600 calories and less than 640 milligrams of sodium , contain fruits and vegetables , and include beverages without excessive fat or sugar . The board overturned the veto of Mayor Gavin Newsom on November 23 to pass the law . The law has been ridiculed by the satirical news program The Daily Show . McDonald 's circumvented the ban by charging 10 cents for the toys . \n In 2014 , McDonald 's added a mascot to Happy Meals in the United States , known as Happy . Happy was originated from France in 2009 . Reactions were mixed , with criticism that the mascot 's design was too frightening . \n In some countries , the choices have been expanded to include items such as a grilled cheese sandwich ( known as a `` Fry Kid '' ) , or more healthy options such as apple slices , a mini snack wrap , salads , or pasta , as one or more of the options . \n The Happy Meal contains a main item ( typically a hamburger , cheeseburger , or small serving of Chicken McNuggets ) , a side item ( french fries , apple slices , a Go - Gurt tube , or a salad in some areas ) , and a drink ( milk , juice , or a soft drink ) . The choice of items changes from country to country , and may depend on the size of the restaurant . \n A class action lawsuit seeking to ban Happy Meal toys in California was filed in 2010 . The suit was dismissed in April 2012 . \n In the mid-1970s , Yolanda Fernández de Cofiño began working with her husband operating McDonald 's restaurants in Guatemala . She created what she called the `` Menu Ronald '' ( Ronald menu ) , which offered a hamburger , small fries and a small sundae to help mothers feed their children more effectively while at McDonald 's restaurants . The concept was eventually brought to the attention of McDonald 's management in Chicago . The company gave the development of the product to Bob Bernstein , who then came up with the Happy Meal . \n A Happy Meal was a form of kids ' meal sold at the fast food restaurant chain McDonald 's since June 1979 . A small toy is included with the food , both of which are usually contained in a red box with a yellow smiley face and the McDonald 's logo . The packaging and toy are frequently part of a marketing tie - in to an existing television show , film , or toy brand . \n The Happy Meal did not introduce the practice of providing small toys to children . When the Happy Meal started in 1979 , the toys back then were a McDoodle stencil , a McWrist wallet , an ID bracelet , a puzzle lock , a spinning top , or a McDonaldland character - shaped eraser . In Canada , the promotion prior to the Happy Meal was called the `` Treat of the Week '' , where a different toy was available free on request each week . This promotion continued after the Happy Meal was introduced in 1979 . Happy Meal toys have become increasingly elaborate in recent years . While initially they were little more than a cheap plastic trinket such as a Frisbee or ball , they have gradually been replaced with increasingly sophisticated toys , many of which are a tie - in to an existing TV show , film , or toy line . \n McDonald 's Happy Meal 10th Anniversary 1977 - 1987 To Robert A. Bernstein , Bernstein - Rein Advertising Thank you for bringing the Happy Meal , a bold idea , to the McDonald 's System . Your insight and conviction truly has made McDonald 's a fun place for children for the past 10 years ! McDonald 's Corporation September , 1987 \n In July 2011 , McDonald 's announced plans to make Happy Meals healthier , including the addition of apples . The redesigned meals will contain a smaller portion ( 1.1 ounces ) of fries , along with the apples . On February 4 , 2013 , McDonald 's announced that Fish McBites , fried Alaskan pollock , the same fish used in Filet - O - Fish , would be added as an entree , which would run until March , intended to coincide with Lent . \n In Chile , the Happy Meal , along with kids ' meals at other fast food chains , will no longer include free toys , in response to a law banning such toys in a move to curb obesity . \n Often , the Happy Meal is themed to promote a current family - oriented movie . The first such promotion was the Star Trek Meal , to promote Star Trek : The Motion Picture in December 1979 . The packaging used for the Star Trek Meal consisted of various images and games related to the film , as well as a comic - strip adaptation of the film . Consumers had to buy numerous meals in order to complete the set . In 1982 , McDonald 's recalled Happy Meal toys because they could have been dangerous to children under 3 years of age . In 1992 , McDonald 's withdrew their range of Happy Meal toys for the film Batman Returns , after complaints from parents that the film was unsuitable for children . \n Bernstein received Trademark # 1136758 ( Serial # 73148046 ) for his idea in 1977 which he assigned to his valued client , McDonald 's Corporation , on June 10 , 1980 . In 1987 at the annual McDonald 's marketing meeting , he was recognized for his accomplishment with a full - size bronze replica of the Happy Meal box with the following inscription :",

    "answers": "",
    "context": "The Neutrality Acts were passed by the United States Congress in the 1930s , in response to the growing turmoil in Europe and Asia that eventually led to World War II . They were spurred by the growth in isolationism and non-interventionism in the US following its costly involvement in World War I , and sought to ensure that the US would not become entangled again in foreign conflicts . \n The provision against unlicensed arms trades of the 1939 act remains in force . \n However , this act did not cover `` civil wars '' , such as that in Spain ( 1936 -- 1939 ) , nor did it cover materials such as trucks and oil . U.S. companies such as Texaco , Standard Oil , Ford , General Motors , and Studebaker exploited this loophole to sell such items to General Franco on credit . By 1939 , Franco owed these and other companies more than $100,000,000 . \n Japan invaded China in July 1937 , starting the Second Sino - Japanese War . President Roosevelt , who supported the Chinese side , chose not to invoke the Neutrality Acts since the parties had not formally declared war . In so doing , he ensured that China 's efforts to defend itself would not be hindered by the legislation : China was dependent on arms imports and only Japan would have been able to take advantage of cash - and - carry . This outraged the isolationists in Congress who claimed that the spirit of the law was being undermined . Roosevelt stated that he would prohibit American ships from transporting arms to the belligerents , but he allowed British ships to transport American arms to China . Roosevelt gave his Quarantine Speech in October 1937 , outlining a move away from neutrality and toward `` quarantining '' all aggressors . He then imposed a `` moral embargo '' on exports of aircraft to Japan . \n After repeated attacks by German submarines on U.S. ships , Roosevelt announced on September 11 , 1941 , that he had ordered the U.S. Navy to attack German and Italian war vessels in the `` waters which we deem necessary for our defense '' . Following the sinking of the U.S. destroyer Reuben James on October 31 , many of the provisions of the Neutrality Acts were repealed on November 17 , 1941 : merchant vessels were allowed to be armed and to carry any cargoes to belligerent nations . The U.S. formally declared war on Japan on December 8 , 1941 following the attack on Pearl Harbor of the previous day ; Germany and Italy declared war on the U.S. on December 11 , 1941 , and the U.S. responded with a declaration of war on the same day . \n Democratic President Roosevelt and especially his Secretary of State Cordell Hull were critical of the Neutrality Acts , fearing that they would restrict the administration 's options to support friendly nations . Even though both the House and Senate had large Democratic majorities throughout these years , there was enough support for the Acts among Democrats ( especially those representing Southern states ) to ensure their passage . Although Congressional support was insufficient to override a presidential veto , Roosevelt felt he could not afford to snub the South and anger public opinion , especially while facing re-election in 1936 and needing Congressional co-operation on domestic issues . With considerable reluctance , the president signed the Neutrality Acts into law . \n In January 1937 , the Congress passed a joint resolution outlawing the arms trade with Spain . The Neutrality Act of 1937 was passed in May and included the provisions of the earlier acts , this time without expiration date , and extended them to cover civil wars as well . Furthermore , U.S. ships were prohibited from transporting any passengers or articles to belligerents , and U.S. citizens were forbidden from traveling on ships of belligerent nations . \n Powerful forces in United States Congress pushing for non-interventionism and strong Neutrality Acts were the Republican Senators William Edgar Borah , Arthur H. Vandenberg , Gerald P. Nye and Robert M. La Follette , Jr. , but support of non-interventionism was not limited to the Republican party . The Ludlow Amendment , requiring a public referendum before any declaration of war except in cases of defense against direct attack , was introduced several times without success between 1935 and 1940 by Democratic Representative Louis Ludlow . \n In September 1939 , after Germany had invaded Poland , Great Britain and France declared war on Germany . Roosevelt invoked the provisions of the Neutrality Act but came before Congress and lamented that the Neutrality Acts may give passive aid to an aggressor country . Congress was divided . Nye wanted to broaden the embargo , and other isolationists like Vandenberg and Hiram Johnson vowed to fight `` from hell to breakfast '' Roosevelt 's desire to loosen the embargo . An `` outstanding Republican leader '' who supported helping nations under attack , however , told H.V. Kaltenborn that the embargo was futile because a neutral country like Italy could buy from the US and sell its own weapons to Germany , while US companies would relocate factories to Canada . \n When Congress passed the Neutrality Act of 1935 , the State Department established an office to enforce the provisions of the Act . The Office of Arms and Munitions Control , renamed the Division of Controls in 1939 when the office was expanded , consisted of Joseph C. Green and Charles W. Yost . \n Roosevelt invoked the act after Italy 's invasion of Ethiopia in October 1935 , preventing all arms and ammunition shipments to Italy and Ethiopia . He also declared a `` moral embargo '' against the belligerents , covering trade not falling under the Neutrality Act . \n The legacy of the Neutrality Acts is widely regarded as having been generally negative : they made no distinction between aggressor and victim , treating both equally as `` belligerents '' ; and they limited the US government 's ability to aid Britain and France against Nazi Germany . The acts were largely repealed in 1941 , in the face of German submarine attacks on U.S. vessels and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . \n Roosevelt 's State Department had lobbied for embargo provisions that would allow the President to impose sanctions selectively . This was rejected by Congress . The 1935 act , signed on August 31 , 1935 , imposed a general embargo on trading in arms and war materials with all parties in a war . It also declared that American citizens traveling on warring ships traveled at their own risk . The act was set to expire after six months . \n In 1948 , Charles Winters , Al Schwimmer and Herman Greenspun were convicted under the 1939 Act after smuggling B - 17 Flying Fortress bombers from Florida to the nascent state of Israel during the 1948 Arab -- Israeli War . All three received Presidential pardons in subsequent decades . \n The end of neutrality policy came with the Lend - Lease Act of March 1941 , which allowed the U.S. to sell , lend or give war materials to nations the US administration wanted to support . \n In a concession to Roosevelt , a `` cash - and - carry '' provision that had been devised by his advisor Bernard Baruch was added : the President could permit the sale of materials and supplies to belligerents in Europe as long as the recipients arranged for the transport and paid immediately with cash , with the argument that this would not draw the U.S. into the conflict . Roosevelt believed that cash - and - carry would aid France and Great Britain in the event of a war with Germany , since they were the only countries that controlled the seas and were able to take advantage of the provision . The cash - and - carry clause was set to expire after two years . \n Early in 1939 , after Nazi Germany had invaded Czechoslovakia , Roosevelt lobbied Congress to have the cash - and - carry provision renewed . He was rebuffed , the provision lapsed , and the mandatory arms embargo remained in place . \n The Neutrality Act of 1936 , passed in February of that year , renewed the provisions of the 1935 act for another 14 months . It also forbade all loans or credits to belligerents . \n The Nye Committee hearings between 1934 and 1936 and several best - selling books of the time , like H.C. Engelbrecht 's The Merchants of Death ( 1934 ) , supported the conviction of many Americans that the U.S. entry into World War I had been orchestrated by bankers and arms dealers for profit reasons . This strengthened the position of isolationists and non-interventionists in the country . \n Roosevelt prevailed over the isolationists , and on November 4 the Neutrality Act of 1939 was passed , allowing for arms trade with belligerent nations ( Great Britain and France ) on a cash - and - carry basis , thus in effect ending the arms embargo . Furthermore , the Neutrality Acts of 1935 and 1937 were repealed , American citizens and ships were barred from entering war zones designated by the President , and the National Munitions Control Board ( which had been created by the 1935 Neutrality Act ) was charged with issuing licenses for all arms imports and exports . Arms trade without a license became a federal crime , with a penalty of up to two years in prison .",

    "answers": "",
    "context": "The term is recognized and often used by media outlets , including ESPN , Yahoo ! , HBO , and Sports Illustrated . \n Bob Ryan , now Vice President and editor - in - chief of NFL Films , coined this for the Cowboys while preparing and editing the team 's 1978 season highlight film . He was quoted as saying : \n In an ESPN.com article titled , `` The Great Debate : ' America 's Team ' , '' four sports writers stated their case as to why three other teams besides the Cowboys could lay claim to the nickname of America 's Team . \n I wanted to come up with a different twist on their team highlight film . I noticed then , and had noticed earlier , that wherever the Cowboys played , you saw people in the stands with Cowboys jerseys and hats and pennants . Plus , they were always the national game on television . \n The popularity of the Cowboys as America 's Team has been supported by such NFL records as `` Team with Most Consecutive Sold Out Games '' , a streak of 160 home and away games ( including playoffs ) that began on December 23 , 1990 , at Philadelphia 's Veterans Stadium and came to an end on December 24 , 1999 , in a Christmas Eve game against the New Orleans Saints in the Louisiana Superdome . Other examples are the NFL games featuring the Cowboys that result in record - breaking ratings at the time of broadcast , such as 7 of the 8 Super Bowl games featuring the Cowboys and the NFC Championship Game between the Cowboys and 49ers , the only non-Super Bowl NFL game to be ranked in the Top 45 Primetime Telecasts of All Time . Dallas is the only NFL team that distributes its own merchandise , which remains among the league 's top selling even during losing seasons . As of 2012 the Cowboys were the most valuable American sports franchise at $2.1 billion . Among the many Cowboys innovations that have contributed to their distinct reputation are their professional , overtly beautiful , all female cheerleader squad , nicknamed `` America 's Sweethearts '' , that has since been copied around the NFL but still stands out as singularly iconic , and has been the subject of multiple movies , has made numerous national television appearances , routinely tours with the USO , makes other appearances around the world , and has been featured in its own long running reality show on CMT . \n In 2003 , NFL Films released a DVD collection chronicling the Dallas Cowboys franchise entitled The Dallas Cowboys : The Complete History of America 's Team 1960 - 2003 . In 2008 , NFL Films would release an updated DVD of The History of the Dallas Cowboys . \n During the Cowboys ' first game of the 1979 season , a nationally televised game against the St. Louis Cardinals ( Dallas won 22 - 21 ) , the television announcer for CBS introduced the Cowboys as America 's Team and the name just stuck . \n I saw all these fans in away stadiums . Hey , they 're the most popular team in the country . How can I use that ? Why do n't we call them `` America 's Team '' ? \n Ryan told the NFL Network for their Top Ten Nicknames show : \n Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney dismissed the suggestion that the Steelers were `` America 's Team . '' `` ' We did n't want that , ' Rooney said . ' We 're Pittsburgh 's team . We feel strongly about that . ' '' \n As a jab against the Cowboys before Super Bowl XXVII , Buffalo Bills coach Marv Levy proclaimed his team to be America 's Team because they would be `` wearing red , white , and blue '' . The Cowboys , which wear white , silver , and blue , went on to defeat the Bills 52 - 17 . \n The Atlanta Braves laid claim to the name due to their games being broadcast on cable television systems nationwide on WTBS , building a fan base in areas of the United States far removed from a Major League Baseball team . A 1982 issue of Sports Illustrated had referred to the Braves as `` America 's Team II '' . \n After several `` Cinderella '' runs in the NCAA tournament , the Gonzaga Bulldogs men 's basketball team has been called `` America 's Team '' as well . \n Franchises with long successful histories and large nationwide fan bases are occasionally referred to as America 's Team . \n They appear on television so often that their faces are as familiar to the public as presidents and movie stars . They are the Dallas Cowboys , `` America 's Team . '' \n In 2012 an ESPN poll found that the Cowboys are the most popular NFL team , a result consistently echoed in annual Harris polling . \n During their ArenaBowl XXII championship run in 2008 , Philadelphia Soul owner Ron Jaworski referred to the Soul as `` America 's Team '' of the Arena Football League . \n Dallas ' Hall of Fame coach Tom Landry originally did not approve of the appellation of America 's Team . He felt that it would give opposing teams extra incentive to play harder . Eventually he gave in and actually came to like the name . The nickname was coined at the height of Landry 's then - NFL record 20 consecutive winning season streak , during which Dallas appeared in 12 conference championship games ( counting the 1966 - 67 league championships ) and five Super Bowls , and was exemplified on the field by the iconic Hall of Fame quarterback Roger Staubach , but the team 's popularity has continued over the decades during periods of both mediocrity and dynastic success . \n Following their win in Super Bowl XLIV , a few media writers referred to the New Orleans Saints as `` America 's Team '' , as their successful bid to win the Super Bowl was seen by many to represent the city 's resurgence after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina ( `` for one game , the Saints are America 's Team '' ) . \n The term America 's Team '' is a nickname that refers to the National Football League ( NFL ) 's Dallas Cowboys . The nickname originated with the team 's 1978 highlight film , where the narrator ( John Facenda ) opens with the following introduction :",

He also co-wrote the screenplay of 1973 's The Harrad Experiment , in which he made a brief appearance . \n Cassidy would reprise the role of Lurch in later appearances . In the Batman episode `` The Penguin 's Nest '' ( 1966 ) , he appears during Batman and Robin 's familiar climb scene up the side of a building , as a tenant who is playing the harpsichord prior to sticking his head out of the window and speaking to Batman and Robin . He also voiced this character in an episode of The New Scooby - Doo Movies ( 1972 ) , which featured the family , as well as in the 1973 animated series adaptation of The Addams Family . \n In deleted scenes from the original Battlestar Galactica TV pilot movie , `` Saga of a Star World '' ( on the DVD collection Battlestar Galactica : The Complete Epic Series ( 1978 ) ) , Cassidy can be heard providing temporary voice tracks of the Cylon Imperious Leader , before actor Patrick Macnee was contracted to voice the character . \n After The Addams Family , Cassidy began to add more voice work to his résumé ; in that acting field , most notably , he narrated the opening of the TV series The Incredible Hulk . Cassidy also provided the Hulk 's growls and roars during the show 's first two seasons . \n Cassidy underwent surgery at St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles to have a non-malignant tumor removed from his heart . While recovering at home , complications arose several days later and he was readmitted . On January 16 , 1979 , Cassidy died at age 46 at St. Vincent Medical Center . \n In the two - part The Six Million Dollar Man episode `` The Return of Bigfoot '' ( 1976 ) , Cassidy appeared as `` Bigfoot '' ( the role was originally played by professional wrestler André the Giant in a previous two - parter ) . He even provided the vocal effects for Bigfoot . Cassidy reprised the role in the 1977 episode `` Bigfoot V . '' \n Concurrent with his appearances on The Addams Family , Cassidy began doing character voices on a recurring basis for the Hanna - Barbera Studios , culminating in the role of Frankenstein , Jr. in Frankenstein , Jr. and The Impossibles series . He was the voice of Meteor Man in Birdman and the Galaxy Trio , as well as the hero in the Chuck Menville pixillated short film Blaze Glory , in which his already - deep voice was enhanced with reverb echo to give the character an exaggerated super-hero sound .

In the 1967 The Man from U.N.C.L.E. episode `` The Napoleon 's Tomb Affair '' , Cassidy played a henchman , Edgar , who kidnaps , tortures , and repeatedly tries to kill Napoleon and Illya . \n Cassidy 's notable height gave him an advantage in auditioning for unusual character roles . His most famous role was Lurch on The Addams Family ( in which he feigned playing the harpsichord ) . He also played the character named Thing ( associate producer Jack Voglin would take over the `` Thing '' role in scenes with both characters ) . Though the character was intended to be mute , Cassidy ad - libbed his signature line , `` You rang ? '' . The subtle humor and the deepness of his voice was immediately a hit .

    "gold": "Bismosal",
    "answers": "",
    "context": "Pepto - Bismol began being sold in 1900 or 1901 by a doctor in New York . It was originally sold as a remedy for infant diarrhea by Norwich Pharmacal Company under the name `` Bismosal : Mixture Cholera Infantum '' . It was renamed Pepto - Bismol in 1919 . Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Procter and Gamble in 1982 . \n Children should not take medication with bismuth subsalicylate while recovering from influenza or chicken pox , as epidemiologic evidence points to an association between the use of salicylate - containing medications during certain viral infections and the onset of Reye 's syndrome . For the same reason , it is typically recommended that nursing mothers not use medication containing bismuth subsalicylate because small amounts of the medication are excreted in human breast milk , and these pose a theoretical risk of Reye 's syndrome to nursing children . \n Organobismuth compounds have historically been used in growth media for selective isolation of microorganisms . Such salts have been shown to inhibit proliferation of Helicobacter pylori , other enteric bacteria , and some fungi . \n Bismuth subsalicylate has the empirical chemical formula of C H BiO , and it is a colloidal substance obtained by hydrolysis of bismuth salicylate ( Bi ( C H ( OH ) CO ) ) . The actual structure is unknown and the formulation is only approximate . \n Long - term use ( greater than 6 weeks ) may lead to accumulation and toxicity . Some of the risks of salicylism can apply to the use of bismuth subsalicylate . \n Bismuth subsalicylate , sold under the brand name Pepto - Bismol , is an antacid medication used to treat temporary discomforts of the stomach and gastrointestinal tract , such as diarrhea , indigestion , heartburn and nausea . It is also commonly known as pink bismuth . \n As a derivative of salicylic acid , bismuth subsalicylate displays anti-inflammatory and bactericidal action . It also acts as an antacid . \n Bismuth subsalicylate is used as an antacid and antidiarrheal , and to treat some other gastrointestinal symptoms , such as nausea . The means by which this occurs is still not well documented . It is thought to be some combination of the following : \n In vitro and in vivo data have shown that bismuth subsalicylate hydrolyzes in the gut to bismuth oxychloride and salicylic acid and less commonly bismuth hydroxide . In the stomach , this is likely an acid - catalyzed hydrolysis . The salicylic acid is absorbed and therapeutical concentrations of salicylic acid can be found in blood after bismuth subsalicylate administration . Bismuth oxychloride and bismuth hydroxide are both believed to have bactericidal effects , as is salicylic acid for enterotoxigenic E. coli a common cause of `` traveler 's diarrhea . '' \n Bismuth subsalicylate is the only active ingredient in an over-the - counter drug that can leave a shiny metal oxide slag behind after being completely burnt with a blow torch . \n As of 1946 , Canadian advertisements placed by Norwich show the product as Pepto - Besmol both in graphic and text . \n Pepto - Bismol is an over-the - counter drug currently produced by the Procter & Gamble company in the United States , Canada and the United Kingdom . Pepto - Bismol is made in chewable tablets and swallowable caplets , but it is best known for its original formula , which is a thick liquid . This original formula is a medium pink in color , with a strong wintergreen or cherry flavor . \n Salicylates are very toxic to cats , and thus bismuth subsalicylate should not be administered to cats . \n There are some adverse effects . It can cause a black tongue and black stools in some users of the drug , when it combines with trace amounts of sulfur in saliva and the colon to form bismuth sulfide . Bismuth sulfide is a highly insoluble black salt , and the discoloration seen is temporary and harmless . \n While bismuth salts were in use in Europe by the late 1700s , the combination of bismuth subsalicylate and zinc salts for astringency with salol ( phenyl salicilate ) appears to have begun in the US in the early 1900s as a remedy for life - threatening diarrhea in infants with cholera . At first sold directly to physicians , it was first marketed as Bismosal in 1918 .",

    "answers": "",
    "context": "The ortolan ( Emberiza hortulana ) or ortolan bunting , is a bird in the bunting family Emberizidae , a passerine family now separated by most modern scholars from the finches , Fringillidae . The genus name Emberiza is from Old High German Embritz , a bunting . The specific hortulana is from the Italian name for this bird , ortolana . The English ortolan is derived from Middle French hortolan , `` gardener '' . \n European Union member states prohibit : \n Ortolan nests are placed on or near the ground . \n The ortolan is served in French cuisine , typically cooked and eaten whole . Traditionally diners cover their heads with their napkin , or a towel while eating the delicacy . The bird is so widely used that its French populations dropped dangerously low , leading to laws restricting its use in 1999 . In September 2007 , the French government announced its intent to enforce long ignored laws protecting the bird . It was famously eaten as the last meal of former French President François Mitterrand before he died in 1996 . \n Ortolan hunting was banned in France in 1999 , but the law was poorly enforced and it is thought that up to 50,000 ortolans were killed each year during the autumn migration : mostly birds from breeding grounds in Finland and the Baltic area . According to France 's League for the Protection of Birds , France 's ortolan population fell 30 % between 1997 and 2007 . In 2007 , the French government vowed to strictly enforce some existing rules about banning the practice , with the maximum fine set at € 6,000 ( £ 4,800 , $6,728 ) . Killing and cooking ortolans is banned across the EU . In 2007 , the pressure from France 's League for Protection of Birds and from the European Union resulted in the French government promising to enforce the EU directive protecting the ortolan . After several years of active citizen watch revealing little if any change in the field situation , the local representative of the government repeated this statement in 2016 . \n The birds are caught with nets set during their autumn migratory flight to Africa . They are then kept in covered cages or boxes . The birds react to the dark cage by gorging themselves on grain , usually millet seed , until they double their bulk . Roman Emperors stabbed out ortolans ' eyes in order to make the birds think it was night , making them eat even more . The birds are then thrown into a container of Armagnac which both drowns and marinates the birds . \n The ortolan is 16 centimetres ( 6.3 in ) in length and weighs 20 -- 25 grams ( 0.71 -- 0.88 oz ) . In appearance and habits it much resembles its relative the yellowhammer , but lacks the bright colouring of that species ; the ortolan 's head , for instance , is greenish - grey , instead of a bright yellow . The song of the male ortolan resembles that of the yellowhammer . \n At one time , the island of Cyprus formed a chief depot for the exportation of ortolans , which were pickled in spices and vinegar and packed in casks containing from 300 to 400 each . In the early 20th century , between 400 and 500 casks were annually exported from Cyprus . \n A native of most European countries and western Asia . It reaches as far north as Scandinavia and beyond the Arctic Circle , frequenting cornfields and their neighbourhoods . It is an uncommon vagrant in spring , and particularly autumn , to the British Isles . \n Seeds are the natural diet , but beetles and other insects are taken when feeding their young . \n The bird is roasted for eight minutes and then plucked . The consumer then places the bird feet first into their mouth while holding onto the bird 's head . The ortolan is then eaten whole , or without the head and the consumer spits out the larger bones . The traditional way French gourmands eat ortolans is to cover their heads and face with a large napkin or towel while consuming the bird . The purpose of the towel is debated . Some claim it is to retain the maximum aroma with the flavour as they consume the entire bird at once , others have stated `` Tradition dictates that this is to shield -- from God 's eyes -- the shame of such a decadent and disgraceful act '' , and others have suggested the towel hides the consumers spitting out bones . This use of the towel was begun by a priest , a friend of Jean Anthelme Brillat - Savarin .",

At the time of JCPenney 's departure , the mall had about a 50 % occupancy . The mall was extensively renovated afterwards and features a 20 - screen AMC Theatres megaplex , and stores traditionally found in power centers such as 24 Hour Fitness and Burlington Coat Factory , in addition to the remaining two original anchors , Macy 's ( formerly Robinsons - May ) and Sears . Ross Dress for Less , Circuit City , Linens ' n Things , Spectrum Club , Burlington Coat Factory , and CompUSA all opened in 1998 . Linens ' n Things , Circuit City , and CompUSA all closed their locations at the mall in 2008 and 2009 . Circuit City and CompUSA had both gone bankrupt while Linens ' n Things was closed as part of a strategy to focus on online shopping . On August 28 , 2010 , the Japanese sports entertainment chain Round1 opened Round1 Bowling & Amusement , a video game arcade and bowling alley , as a new anchor . It was the company 's first overseas store , replacing Linens ' n Things ' . \n Due to the large and influential Asian immigrant populations residing and / or operating businesses in nearby areas ( notably in Industry , Hacienda Heights , Rowland Heights , Walnut , and Diamond Bar ) , some redesigns of the mall incorporated feng shui principles . \n On May 31 , 2018 , it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 72 stores nationwide . The store will close in September 2018 . \n Puente Hills Mall served as a filming location for the fictional Twin Pines Mall ( later Lone Pine Mall ) in the 1985 film Back to the Future .

The newest addition to the mall , Toys `` R '' Us , opened its doors in June 2011 , taking the spot previously occupied by Circuit City . Toys `` R '' Us had formerly been located at the Plaza at Puente Hills on Gale Avenue in Industry . The store shut down on April 15 , 2018 . \n Puente Hills Mall featured replicas of the Twin Pines Mall sign , the time machine , and Dr. E. Brown Enterprises truck in its parking lot in October 2015 . \n Puente Hills Mall was built in 1974 after the completion of the Pomona Freeway a few years earlier . It opened with four primary anchors in a cross-shaped design by The Hahn Company . One of the mall 's original tenants was the first Foot Locker store which still stands there today . \n The center of the mall previously featured a large cubed water fountain , then a merry - go - round attraction built in 1990 , but it was later removed by the mall 's owners , Krausz Companies , as they were losing money in its operation . An East Asian - style koi pond replaced the carousel , but was removed as of 2006 . The koi were moved to Sycamore Lake at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier .

Pradeep performed the song for Nehru on 21 March 1963 at a function at R.M. High School in Mumbai . He also presented Nehru with the original handwritten lyrics of the song . \n Recalling the song in 2013 , Mangeshkar stated that she never expected the song to be so successful saying , `` Since it was not part of a film , I thought it would have a limited impact . Ae mere watan ke logon became my signature tune . No show of mine , no concert or event is complete until I sing it . '' She also stated that Pradeep was always sure of the song 's success saying , `` Only Pradeepji had faith in the song . He had prophesied to me , ' Lata , tum dekhna yeh gaana bahot chalega . Log hamesha ke liye issey yaad rakhenge ( You 'll see this song will endure . People will always remember it ) . \n Aye Mere Watan Ke Logo was written by Kavi Pradeep to commemorate the Indian soldiers who died during the Sino - Indian War . Pradeep was deeply moved by accounts of casualties of the war . In late 1962 , while taking a walk along Mahim beach in Mumbai , Pradeep received a sudden bout of inspiration . He borrowed a pen from a fellow walker , and wrote the opening stanza of the song on a foil that he ripped out from his cigarette pack . A few weeks later , Pradeep was approached by producer Mehboob Khan to write a song for a fund - raiser scheduled to be held at the National Stadium in New Delhi . Pradeep accepted the offer , but did not reveal any details about the song he intended to write . He recruited music director C. Ramchandra to write the music , and Lata Mangeshkar to perform the song . According to Pradeep 's daughter , Mitul , `` Due to some misunderstanding between Ramchandra and Lata - didi , it was to be sung by Asha Bhosale .

But with a rider - Mr Pradeep must be present at the rehearsals ! '' \n The song received rave appreciation from across the country . \n The song is often rendered at patriotic occasions in India , and is one of the most prominent patriotic songs alongside Jana Gana Mana ( the national anthem ) , Vande Mataram ( the national song ) , and Sare Jahan se Accha . \n `` Aye Mere Watan Ke Logo '' ( Hindi : ऐ मेरे वतन के लोगों ; `` O ' people of my country '' ) is a Hindi patriotic song written by Kavi Pradeep , composed by C. Ramchandra , and performed by Lata Mangeshkar . The song commemorates Indian soldiers who died during the Sino - Indian War in 1962 . The song was first performed live by Mangeshkar on 27 January 1963 at the National Stadium in New Delhi in the presence of President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru , on account of Republic Day ( 26 January ) 1963 , which was just two months after the end of the war . \n In January 2013 , Lata Mangeshkar told a TV channel that initially she had declined to sing the song as she had not enough time to rehearse it . `` It was Pradeepji , ( Kavi Pradeep ) the poet , who wrote the immortal lyrics , who came to me and asked me to sing the song . I declined , because there was no time to rehearse . You see , at that time I was working round - the - clock . To give special attention to one song seemed impossible . But Pradeepji insisted , '' Lata said , admitting that she was very nervous before the performance . Kavi Pradeep , the man who penned lyrics of the song , could n't witness the event . `` My regret is that Pradeepji had not been called for the Republic Day function where I sang the song . If he was there , he would have seen with his own eyes what impact ' Ae mere watan ke logo ' had , '' Lata told . \n Brigadier Chitranjan Sawant , who served in the Sino - Indian War , stated that the song inspired soldiers to withstand the difficult situations they were in . \n The song was first performed live on 27 January 1963 , by Lata Mangeshkar at an event at the National Stadium in New Delhi in the presence of President S. Radhakrishnan and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru , on account of Republic Day ( 26 January ) 1963 , which was just two months after the end of the war . Mangeshkar sang two songs at the event , opening with the bhajan ( devotional song ) Allah tero naam followed by Ae mere watan ke logon . The performance of the latter song moved Nehru to tears . `` Those who do n't feel inspired by Aye mere watan ke logo do n't deserve to be called a Hindustani '' , said Nehru , who was visibly moved by the song . \n According to Mangeshkar , `` I suggested we format the song into a duet with me and my sister Asha ( Bhosle ) . Pradeepji wanted it to be a solo . I insisted that we do it as a duet . In fact , Asha had even rehearsed for the song . Then , days before we were to fly to Delhi , she came to me and said , ' Didi , I 'm not coming to Delhi . ' I tried to convince her to change her mind arguing that her name had even been printed in the newspapers as one of the singers . But she was adamant . Composer - singer Hemant Kumar had actually orchestrated the whole project . I told Hemantda about Asha 's decision to not accompany us to Delhi to perform the song . Hemantda also tried to convince Asha . Lekin who nahin manee ( But she did n't relent ) . Then it was left to me to rehearse alone for the song . '' \n All of the artists and technicians involved with the song -- including singers , musicians , music director , lyricist , recording studio , sound recordist -- pledged the royalty of the song in perpetuity to the War Widows Fund . Per Pradeep 's last wishes , royalties for sale of records of the song were to be donated to war widows . In 2005 , the Bombay High Court asked the music company HMV to indicate a lump sum payable to the Army Welfare Fund for the disabled and war widows from the song 's royalty proceeds .",

    "context": "T Tauri stars ( TTS ) are a class of variable stars named after their prototype -- T Tauri . They are found near molecular clouds and identified by their optical variability and strong chromospheric lines . T Tauri stars are pre-main - sequence stars in the process of contracting to the main sequence along the Hayashi track , a luminosity -- temperature relationship obeyed by infant stars of less than 3 solar masses ( M ) in the pre-main - sequence phase of stellar evolution . It ends when a star of 0.5 M develops a radiative zone , or when a larger star commences nuclear fusion on the main sequence . \n There exist several types of TTSs : \n It will not occur in stars with less than sixty times the mass of Jupiter ( M ) . In this way , the rate of lithium depletion can be used to calculate the age of the star . \n 2 M ) . Their surface temperatures are similar to those of main - sequence stars of the same mass , but they are significantly more luminous because their radii are larger . Their central temperatures are too low for hydrogen fusion . Instead , they are powered by gravitational energy released as the stars contract , while moving towards the main sequence , which they reach after about 100 million years . They typically rotate with a period between one and twelve days , compared to a month for the Sun , and are very active and variable . \n Analogs of T Tauri stars in the higher mass range ( 2 -- 8 solar masses ) -- A and B spectral type pre -- main - sequence stars , are called Herbig Ae / Be-type stars . More massive ( > 8 Solar mass ) stars in pre -- main sequence stage are not observed , because they evolve very quickly : when they become visible ( i.e. disperses surrounding circumstellar gas and dust cloud ) , the hydrogen in the center is already burning and they are main sequence objects . \n There is evidence of large areas of starspot coverage , and they have intense and variable X-ray and radio emissions ( approximately 1000 times that of the Sun ) . Many have extremely powerful stellar winds ; some eject gas in high - velocity bipolar jets . Another source of brightness variability are clumps ( protoplanets and planetesimals ) in the disk surrounding T Tauri stars . \n Their spectra show a higher lithium abundance than the Sun and other main - sequence stars because lithium is destroyed at temperatures above 2,500,000 K. From a study of lithium abundances in 53 T Tauri stars , it has been found that lithium depletion varies strongly with size , suggesting that `` lithium burning '' by the P-P chain , during the last highly convective and unstable stages during the later pre -- main sequence phase of the Hayashi contraction may be one of the main sources of energy for T Tauri stars . Rapid rotation tends to improve mixing and increase the transport of lithium into deeper layers where it is destroyed . T Tauri stars generally increase their rotation rates as they age , through contraction and spin - up , as they conserve angular momentum . This causes an increased rate of lithium loss with age . Lithium burning will also increase with higher temperatures and mass , and will last for at most a little over 100 million years . \n The P-P chain for Lithium burning is as follows \n Roughly half of T Tauri stars have circumstellar disks , which in this case are called protoplanetary discs because they are probably the progenitors of planetary systems like the Solar System . Circumstellar discs are estimated to dissipate on timescales of up to 10 million years . Most T Tauri stars are in binary star systems . In various stages of their life , they are called Young Stellar Objects ( YSOs ) . It is thought that the active magnetic fields and strong solar wind of Alfvén waves of T Tauri stars are one means by which angular momentum gets transferred from the star to the protoplanetary disc . AT Tauri stage for the Solar System would be one means by which the angular momentum of the contracting Sun was transferred to the protoplanetary disc and hence , eventually to the planets . \n T Tauri stars are the youngest visible F , G , K , M spectral type stars ( \n Planets around T Tauri stars include :",

Endoscopic treatment for sciatic nerve entrapment has been investigated in deep gluteal syndrome ; `` Patients were treated with sciatic nerve decompression by resection of fibrovascular scar bands , piriformis tendon release , obturator internus , or quadratus femoris or by hamstring tendon scarring . '' \n Pain caused by a compression or irritation of the sciatic nerve by a problem in the lower back is called sciatica . Common causes of sciatica include the following lower back and hip conditions : spinal disc herniation , degenerative disc disease , lumbar spinal stenosis , spondylolisthesis , and piriformis syndrome . Other acute causes of sciatica include coughing , muscular hypertension , and sneezing . \n The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the human body . \n Bernese periacetabular osteotomy resulted in major nerve deficits in the sciatic or femoral nerves in 2.1 % of 1760 patients , of whom approximately half experienced complete recovery within a mean of 5.5 months . \n This article incorporates text in the public domain from page 960 of the 20th edition of Gray 's Anatomy ( 1918 ) \n The sciatic nerve supplies sensation to the skin of the foot , as well as the entire lower leg ( except for its inner side ) . Sensation to skin to the sole of the foot is provided by the tibial nerve , and the lower leg and upper surface of the foot via the common fibular nerve . \n Structures surrounding left hip - joint . \n The sciatic nerve also innervates muscles . In particular : \n Sciatic nerve injury occurs between 0.5 % and 2.0 % of the time during total hip arthroplasty . Sciatic nerve palsy is a complication of total hip arthroplasty with an incidence of 0.2 % to 2.8 % of the time , or with an incidence of 1.7 % to 7.6 % following revision . Following the procedure , in rare cases , a screw , broken piece of trochanteric wire , fragment of methyl methacrylate bone cement , or Burch - Schneider metal cage can impinge on the nerve ; this can cause sciatic nerve palsy which may resolve after the fragment is removed and the nerve freed . The nerve can be surrounded in oxidized regenerated cellulose to prevent further scarring . Sciatic nerve palsy can also result from severe spinal stenosis following the procedure , which can be addressed by spinal decompression surgery . It is unclear if inversion therapy is able to decompress the sacral vertebrae , it may only work on the lumbar aspects of the sciatic nerves . \n The sciatic nerve is formed from the L4 to S3 segments of the sacral plexus , a collection of nerve fibres that emerge from the sacral part of the spinal cord . The fibres unite to form a single nerve in front of the piriformis muscle . The nerve passes beneath piriformis and through the greater sciatic foramen , exiting the pelvis . From here , it travels down the posterior thigh to the popliteal fossa . The nerve travels in the posterior compartment of the thigh behind ( superficial to ) the adductor magnus muscle , and is itself in front of ( deep to ) one head of the biceps femoris muscle . At the popliteal fossa , the nerve divides into its two branches : \n Nerves of the right lower extremity . Posterior view . \n Sciatic nerve injury may also occur from improperly performed injections into the buttock , and may result in sensory loss . \n Signals from the sciatic nerve and it branches can be blocked , in order to interrupted transmission of pain signal from the innervation area , by performing a regional nerve blockade called a sciatic nerve block . \n The sciatic nerve ( / saɪˈætɪk / ; also called ischiadic nerve , ischiatic nerve ) is a large nerve in humans and animals . It begins in the lower back and runs through the buttock and down the lower limb . It is the longest and widest single nerve in the human body , going from the top of the leg to the foot on the posterior aspect . The sciatic nerve provides the connection to the nervous system for nearly the whole of the skin of the leg , the muscles of the back of the thigh , and those of the leg and foot . It is derived from spinal nerves L4 to S3 . It contains fibers from both the anterior and posterior divisions of the lumbosacral plexus .",

    "gold": "between the epidermis -- the upper layer of the skin -- and the layers below",
    "answers": "",
    "context": "A lubricant , typically talcum powder , can be used to reduce friction between skin and apparel in the short term . People put talcum powder inside gloves or shoes for this purpose , although this type of lubricant will increase the friction in the long term , as it absorbs moisture . Increased friction makes blisters more likely . \n There are also a number of medical conditions that cause blisters . The most common are chickenpox , herpes , impetigo , and a form of eczema called dyshidrosis . Other , much rarer conditions that cause blisters include : \n Intense rubbing can cause a blister , as can any friction on the skin if continued long enough . This kind of blister is most common after walking long distances or by wearing old or poorly fitting shoes . Blisters are most common on the hands and feet , as these extremities are susceptible while walking , running , or performing repetitive motions , such as joystick manipulation whilst playing certain video games , digging with a shovel , playing guitar , etc . Blisters form more easily on moist skin than on dry or soaked skin , and are more common in warm conditions . Less - aggressive rubbing over long periods of time may cause calluses to form rather than a blister . Both blisters and calluses can lead to more serious complications , such as foot ulceration and infection , particularly when sensation or circulation is impaired , as in the case of diabetes , neuropathy or peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) . \n Sometimes , the skin will blister when it comes into contact with a cosmetic , detergent , solvent , or other chemical such as nickel sulfate , Balsam of Peru , or urushiol ( poison ivy , poison oak , poison sumac ) . This is known as contact dermatitis . Blisters can also develop as a result of an allergic reaction to an insect bite or sting . Some chemical warfare agents , known as blister agents or vesicants , cause large , painful blisters wherever they contact skin ; an example is mustard gas . \n A blister is a small pocket of body fluid ( lymph , serum , plasma , blood , or pus ) within the upper layers of the skin , typically caused by forceful rubbing ( friction ) , burning , freezing , chemical exposure or infection . Most blisters are filled with a clear fluid , either serum or plasma . However , blisters can be filled with blood ( known as `` blood blisters '' ) or with pus ( for instance , if they become infected ) . \n Friction blisters are caused by excess shear stress between the surface of the skin and the body . The strata of skin around the Stratum spinosum are most susceptible to shear . As the Stratum spinosum tears away from the connecting tissues below , plasma from the cells diffuses out . This plasma solution helps new cells divide and grow into new connective tissues and epidermal layers . \n Even before a `` hot '' or irritated area on the foot is felt , taping a protective layer of padding or a friction - reducing interface between the affected area and the footwear can prevent the formation of a blister . Bandages , moleskin and tapes generally must be applied to the foot daily , and most have a very high coefficient of friction ( COF ) , but a friction - management patch applied to the shoe will remain in place much longer , throughout many changes of socks and insoles . This type of intervention may be used with footwear that is worn daily , with specialty shoes and boots like hockey skates , ice skates , inline skates , ski boots and cleats , or even with orthotic braces and splints . For periods of sustained use such as hiking and trail running , especially where water ingress or moisture build up in the shoe or boot can occur , moisture wicking liner socks can provide the required friction protection . \n A blister may form when the skin has been damaged by friction or rubbing , heat , cold or chemical exposure . Fluid collects between the epidermis -- the upper layer of the skin -- and the layers below . This fluid cushions the tissue underneath , protecting it from further damage and allowing it to heal . \n Friction blisters , caused by rubbing against the skin , can be prevented by reducing the friction to a level where blisters will not form . This can be accomplished in a variety of ways . \n A blood blister usually forms when a minute blood vessel close to the surface of the skin ruptures ( breaks ) , and blood leaks into a tear between the layers of skin . This can happen if the skin is crushed , pinched or aggressively squeezed . \n To heal properly , a blister should not be popped unless medically necessary . If popped , the excess skin should not be removed because the skin underneath needs that top layer to heal properly . \n This type of blistering is one of the tools used to determine the degree of burns sustained . First and second degree burns may result in blistered skin ; however , it is characteristic of second degree burns to blister immediately , whereas first degree burns can have blisters after a couple of days . Blisters can also form on the hands and feet as a result of tissue damage incurred by frostbite . \n To avoid friction blisters on the hands , gloves should be worn when using tools such as a shovel or pickaxe , doing manual work such as gardening , or using sports equipment like golf clubs or baseball bats . Oars used for competitive rowing are known for causing frequent blisters on the hands of oarsmen . Weightlifters are also prone to blisters as are gymnasts from the friction developed by the rubbing against the bars . To further reduce the occurrence one can tape the hands , and there are also a number of products on the market that claim to reduce the occurrence of blisters . These are all intended to be worn as a liner underneath a glove . The majority of these offerings simply add padding and create a layer that reduces the coefficient of friction between the skin and the glove . \n Sunscreen and protective clothing should also be used during the hottest part of the day to avoid blisters from sunburn . Avoiding sunlight during midday is the best way to avoid blisters from sunburn . Protective gloves should be worn when handling detergents , cleaning products , solvents and other chemicals . \n The word `` blister '' entered English in the 14th century . It came from the Middle Dutch `` bluyster '' and was a modification of the Old French `` blostre '' , which meant a leprous nodule -- a rise in the skin due to leprosy . In dermatology today , the words vesicle and bulla refer to blisters of smaller or greater size , respectively . \n The clear fluid will be reabsorbed as new cells develop and the swollen appearance will subside . Painful blisters located on hands ( palmar surface ) and feet ( plantar surface ) are due to tissue shearing deeper in the epidermis , near nerve endings . Lower tissues are more susceptible to infection . \n Blisters on the feet can be prevented by wearing comfortable , well - fitting shoes and clean socks . Inherently ill - fitting or stiffer shoes , such as high heels and dress shoes , present a larger risk of blistering . Blisters are more likely to develop on skin that is moist , so socks that manage moisture or frequent sock changes will aid those with particularly sweaty feet . While exercising or playing sports , special sports socks can help keep feet drier and reduce the chance of blisters . Before going for a long walk , it is also important to ensure that shoes or hiking boots have been properly broken in .",

Under the trial plan , which must still be approved by World Rugby , a try would be worth six points instead of five , with penalty tries worth eight points with no conversion attempt taken . In addition , penalties and drop goals would be reduced from three points to two . \n In both rugby union and rugby league , a conversion is worth two points ; a successful kick at goal thus converts a five - point try to seven for rugby union , and a four - point try to six for rugby league . \n A try is a way of scoring points in rugby union and rugby league football . A try is scored by grounding the ball ( the ball must be touching the player when coming into contact with the ground ) in the opposition 's in - goal area ( on or behind the goal line ) . Rugby union and league differ slightly in defining ' grounding the ball ' and the ' in - goal ' area . \n In rugby union , the value of a try has varied over time , from none to five points . In rugby league , the original value was three ; this was increased to four in 1983 . \n The term try comes from try at goal , signifying that originally , grounding the ball only gave the opportunity to try to score with a kick at goal . \n In rugby league , an 8 - point try is awarded if the defending team commits an act of foul play as the ball is being grounded . The try is awarded , and is followed by a conversion attempt , in - line from where the try was scored , and then a penalty kick from in front of the posts . In rugby union , foul play after a try being scored results in a penalty being awarded on the half way mark , in lieu of a kick off . \n In both codes , when a try is scored , the scoring team gets to attempt a conversion , which is a kick at goal to convert the try from one set of points into another larger set of points . The kick is taken at any point on the field of play in line with the point that the ball was grounded for the try , and parallel to the touch - lines . If successful , additional points are scored . For the conversion to be successful , the ball must pass over the crossbar and between the uprights . In both codes , the conversion may be attempted as either a place kick ( from the ground ) or a drop kick . Most players will nevertheless opt for a place kick , this being generally regarded as the easier skill . Note , however , that in both rugby sevens ( usually , but not always , played under union rules ) and rugby league nines , conversions may only take place as drop kicks . In rugby league , the game clock continues during preparation and execution of a conversion , with the institution of a 25 - second shot clock at certain tournaments from the moment the try is awarded by the referee , within which time the conversion kick must be taken , hence a team may decline a conversion attempt if recommencing play as quickly as possible is advantageous to them . \n There are differences in the fine detail of the laws and their interpretation between the two rugby codes . These are the common aspects , while the differences are treated below . \n Modern rugby and all derived forms now favour the try over a goal and thus the try has a definite value , that has increased over time and has for many years surpassed the number of points awarded for a goal . In rugby league and rugby union , a conversion attempt is still given , but is simply seen as adding extra ' bonus ' points . These points , however , can mean the difference between winning or losing a match , so thought is given to fielding players with good goal - kicking skill . \n In both rugby league and rugby union , if the referee believes that a try has been prevented by the defending team 's misconduct , he may award the attacking team a penalty try . Penalty tries are always awarded under the posts regardless of where the offence took place . In rugby union , the standard applied by the referee is that a try `` probably '' would have been scored . The referee does not have to be certain a try would have been scored . In rugby league , the referee `` may award a penalty try if , in his opinion , a try would have been scored but for the unfair play of the defending team '' . \n A try is analogous to a touchdown in American and Canadian football , with the major difference being that a try requires the ball be simultaneously touching the ground in the in - goal area and an attacking player who is in the field of play or in - goal . In the laws of both codes of rugby , the term touch down formally refers only to grounding the ball by the defensive team in their in - goal . \n To make the conversion easier , attacking players will try to ground the ball as close to the centre of the in - goal area as possible . The attacking player will , however , ground the ball when confronted by a defender rather than risk losing the ball by being tackled or passing it to a teammate . \n Since 1979 , in rugby union , the `` try '' and `` conversion goal '' have been officially considered as separate scores . Before then , the converted try was officially a single score called a goal from a try which replaced the score of the ( unconverted ) `` try '' . The change allowed the player who touched down for the try and the player who kicked the conversion to be credited separately for their portions of the score . \n In rugby union , a try is worth five points , in rugby league , four . Although a try is worth less in rugby league , it is more often the main method of scoring due to the smaller value of a goal kick and surety of possession . In rugby union , however , there is heavier reliance placed on goals to accumulate points at elite levels due to the significant value of goals and the defending team 's skills . \n In early forms of rugby football , the point of the game was to score goals . A try ( at goal ) was awarded for grounding the ball in the opponents in - goal area . The try had zero value itself , but allowed the attacking team to try a kick at goal without interference from the other team . This kick , if successful , converts a try into a goal .",

    "answers": "",
    "context": "Protective factors , while not an inherent component of the diathesis -- stress model , are of importance when considering the interaction of diatheses and stress . Protective factors can mitigate or provide a buffer against the effects of major stressors by providing an individual with developmentally adaptive outlets to deal with stress . Examples of protective factors include a positive parent - child attachment relationship , a supportive peer network , and individual social and emotional competence . \n The diathesis , or predisposition , interacts with the individual 's subsequent stress response . Stress is a life event or series of events that disrupts a person 's psychological equilibrium and may catalyze the development of a disorder . Thus the diathesis -- stress model serves to explore how biological or genetic traits ( diatheses ) interact with environmental influences ( stressors ) to produce disorders such as depression , anxiety , or schizophrenia . \n Protective factors , such as positive social networks or high self - esteem , can counteract the effects of stressors and prevent or curb the effects of disorder . Many psychological disorders have a window of vulnerability , during which time an individual is more likely to develop disorder than others . Diathesis -- stress models are often conceptualized as multi-causal developmental models , which propose that multiple risk factors over the course of development interact with stressors and protective factors contributing to normal development or psychopathology . The differential susceptibility hypothesis is a recent theory that has stemmed from the diathesis -- stress model . \n The term diathesis is synonymous with vulnerability . A vulnerability makes it more or less likely that an individual will succumb to the development of psychopathology if a certain stress is encountered . Diatheses are considered inherent within the individual and are typically conceptualized as being stable , but not unchangeable , over the lifespan . They are also often considered latent ( i.e. dormant ) , because they are harder to recognize unless provoked by stressors . \n Diatheses are understood to include genetic , biological , physiological , cognitive , and personality - related factors . Some examples of diatheses include genetic factors , such as abnormalities in some genes or variations in multiple genes that interact to increase vulnerability . Other diatheses include early life experiences such as the loss of a parent , or high neuroticism . Diatheses can also be conceptualized as situational factors , such as low socio - economic status or having a parent with depression . \n The diathesis -- stress model has also served as useful in explaining other poor ( but non-clinical ) developmental outcomes . \n Many models of psychopathology generally suggest that all people have some level of vulnerability towards certain mental disorders , but posit a large range of individual differences in the point at which a person will develop a certain disorder . For example , an individual with personality traits that tend to promote relationships such as extroversion and agreeableness may engender strong social support , which may later serve as a protective factor when experiencing stressors or losses that may delay or prevent the development of depression . Conversely , an individual who finds it difficult to develop and maintain supportive relationships may be more vulnerable to developing depression following a job loss because they do not have protective social support . An individual 's threshold is determined by the interaction of diatheses and stress . \n The diathesis -- stress model asserts that if the combination of the predisposition and the stress exceeds a threshold , the person will develop a disorder . \n Stress can be conceptualized as a life event that disrupts the equilibrium of a person 's life . For instance , a person may be vulnerable to become depressed , but will not develop depression unless he or she is exposed to a specific stress , which may trigger a depressive disorder . Stressors can take the form of a discrete event , such the divorce of parents or a death in the family , or can be more chronic factors such as having a long - term illness , or ongoing marital problems . Stresses can also be related to more daily hassles such as school assignment deadlines . \n Windows of vulnerability for developing specific psychopathologies are believed to exist at different points of the lifespan . Moreover , different diatheses and stressors are implicated in different disorders . For example , breakups and other severe or traumatic life stressors are implicated in the development of depression . Stressful events can also trigger the manic phase of bipolar disorder and stressful events can then prevent recovery and trigger relapse . Having a genetic disposition for becoming addicted and later engaging in binge drinking in college are implicated in the development of alcoholism . A family history of schizophrenia combined with the stressor of being raised in a dysfunctional family raises the risk of developing schizophrenia . \n Diathesis -- stress models are often conceptualized as multi-causal developmental models , which propose that multiple risk factors over the course of development interact with stressors and protective factors contributing to normal development or psychopathology . For example , a child with a family history of depression likely has a genetic vulnerability to depressive disorder . This child has also been exposed to environmental factors associated with parental depression that increase his or her vulnerability to developing depression as well . Protective factors , such as strong peer network , involvement in extracurricular activities , and a positive relationship with the non-depressed parent , interact with the child 's vulnerabilities in determining the progression to psychopathology versus normative development . \n It has been long recognized that stress plays a significant role in understanding how psychopathology develops in individuals . However , psychologists have also identified that not all individuals who are stressed , or go through stressful life events , develop a psychological disorder . To understand this , theorists and researchers explored other factors that affect the development of a disorder and proposed that some individuals under stress develop a disorder and others do not . As such , some individuals are more vulnerable than others to develop a disorder once stress has been introduced . This led to the formulation of the diathesis -- stress model . \n The diathesis -- stress model is a psychological theory that attempts to explain a disorder as the result of an interaction between a predispositional vulnerability and a stress caused by life experiences . The term diathesis derives from the Greek term ( διάθεσις ) for a predisposition , or vulnerability . A diathesis can take the form of genetic , psychological , biological , or situational factors . A large range of differences exists among individuals ' vulnerabilities to the development of a disorder . \n Some theories have branched from the diathesis -- stress model , such as the differential susceptibility hypothesis , which extends the model to include a vulnerability to positive environments as well as negative environments or stress . A person could have a biological vulnerability that when combined with a stressor could lead to psychopathology ( diathesis -- stress model ) ; but that same person with a biological vulnerability , if exposed to a particularly positive environment , could have better outcomes than a person without the vulnerability . \n The use of the term diathesis in medicine and in the specialty of psychiatry dates back to the 1800s ; however , the diathesis -- stress model was not introduced and used to describe the development of psychopathology until it was applied to explaining schizophrenia in the 1960s by Paul Meehl . The diathesis -- stress model is used in many fields of psychology , specifically for studying the development of psychopathology . It is useful for the purposes of understanding the interplay of nature and nurture in the susceptibility to psychological disorders throughout the lifespan . Diathesis -- stress models can also assist in determining who will develop a disorder and who will not . For example , in the context of depression , the diathesis -- stress model can help explain why Person A may become depressed while Person B does not , even when exposed to the same stressors . More recently , the diathesis -- stress model has been used to explain why some individuals are more at risk for developing a disorder than others . For example , children who have a family history of depression are generally more vulnerable to developing a depressive disorder themselves . A child who has a family history of depression and who has been exposed to a particular stressor , such as exclusion or rejection by his or her peers , would be more likely to develop depression than a child with a family history of depression that has an otherwise positive social network of peers .",

    "q_neg": "When was lead based paint not banned in Canada?",
    "gold": "1976",
    "answers": "",
    "context": "The European Union has passed a directive controlling lead paint use . \n The United States ' Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) banned lead paint in 1977 in residential properties and public buildings ( 16 CFR 1303 ) , along with toys and furniture containing lead paint . The cited reason was `` to reduce the risk of lead poisoning in children who may ingest paint chips or peelings . '' For manufacturers , the CPSC instituted the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 , which changed the cap on lead content in paint from 0.06 % to 0.009 % starting August 14 , 2009 . \n Despite the risks , the pigment was very popular with artists because of its density and opacity ; a small amount could cover a large surface . It was widely used by artists until the 19th century , when it was replaced by zinc white and titanium white . \n Lead paint is not prohibited in India . A 2015 study found that over 31 % of household paints in India had lead concentration above 10,000 parts per million ( ppm ) , which far exceeds the BIS standard of 90 ppm for lead in paint . \n Flake white has various drawbacks , including a tendency to become transparent over time . It also blackens in the presence of certain atmospheric pollutants , although this can be reversed . \n Lead is not a traditional pigment in water mediums , as zinc is superior for works on paper , as is calcium hydroxide ( slaked lime ) for frescos . Lead - based paints , when used on paper , often cause the work to become discolored after long periods of time ; the paint 's lead carbonate reacts with hydrogen sulfide in the air and with acids , which often come from fingerprints . \n Lead paint or lead - based paint is paint containing lead . As pigment , lead ( II ) chromate ( Pb Cr O , `` chrome yellow '' ) , Lead ( II , IV ) oxide , ( Pb O , `` red lead '' ) , and lead ( II ) carbonate ( Pb C O , `` white lead '' ) are the most common forms . Lead is added to paint to speed up drying , increase durability , maintain a fresh appearance , and resist moisture that causes corrosion . It is one of the main health and environmental hazards associated with paint . In some countries , lead continues to be added to paint intended for domestic use , whereas countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. have regulations prohibiting this , although lead paint may still be found in older properties painted prior to the introduction of such regulations . Although lead has been banned from household paints in the United States since 1978 , paint used in road markings may still contain it . Alternatives such as water - based , lead - free traffic paint are readily available , and many states and federal agencies have changed their purchasing contracts to buy these instead . \n The traditional method making the pigment was called the stack process . Hundreds or thousands of earthenware pots containing vinegar and lead were embedded in a layer of either tan bark or cow feces . The pots were designed so that the vinegar and lead were in separate compartments , but the lead was in contact with the vapor of the vinegar . The lead was usually coiled into a spiral , and placed on a ledge inside the pot . The pot was loosely covered with a grid of lead , which allowed the carbon dioxide formed by the fermentation of the tan bark or the dung to circulate in the pot . Each layer of pots was covered by a new layer of tan , then another layer of pots . the heat created by the fermentation , acetic acid vapor and carbon dioxide within the stack did their work , and within a month the lead coils were covered with a crust of white lead . This crust was separated from the lead , washed and ground for pigment . This was an extremely dangerous process for the workmen . Medieval texts warned of the danger of `` apoplexy , epilepsy , and paralysis '' from working with lead white . \n In Canada , regulations were first enacted under the Hazardous Products Act in 1976 that limited lead content of paints and other liquid coatings on furniture , household products , children 's products , and exterior and interior surfaces of any building frequented by children to 0.5 % by weight . New regulations on surface coating materials , which came into force in 2005 , further limit lead to its background level for both interior and exterior paints sold to consumers . Canadian paint manufacturers have been conforming to this background level in their interior and exterior consumer paints since 1991 . Nevertheless , a Canadian company , Dominion Colour Corporation , is `` the largest manufacturer of lead - based paint pigments in the world '' and has faced public criticism for obtaining permission from the European Chemicals Agency to continue to export lead chromate paints from its Dutch subsidiary to countries where its uses are not tightly regulated . \n In April 2010 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency required that all renovators working in homes built before 1978 and disturbing more than six square feet of lead paint inside the home or 20 square feet outside the home be certified . EPA 's Lead Renovation , Repair and Painting Rule ( RRP Rule ) lowers the risk of lead contamination from home renovation activities . It requires that firms performing renovation , repair , and painting projects that disturb lead - based paint in homes , child care facilities and pre-schools ( any child occupied facility ) built before 1978 be certified by EPA and use certified renovators who are trained by EPA - approved training providers to follow lead - safe work practices . \n Lead white was being produced during the 4th century BC ; the process is described by Pliny the Elder , Vitruvius and the ancient Greek author Theophrastus . \n Titanium and zinc whites are far less toxic than lead white and have largely supplanted it in most fine arts applications . Safety regulations have also made lead white more expensive and difficult to obtain in some regions , such as the EU . However , lead white oil paints are still produced and in use by artists who prefer their unique handling , mixing , and structural qualities . \n Paint manufacturers have replaced white lead with a less toxic substitute , titanium white ( based on the pigment titanium dioxide ) , which was first used in paints in the 19th century . Titanium dioxide is considered safe enough to use as a food coloring and in toothpaste . It is also a common ingredient in sunscreen . When used in paints today , it is often coated with silicon or aluminum oxides for durability . Titanium white has far greater opacity and tinting strength than lead white , and it can easily overpower most other pigments if not mixed carefully . Titanium white has been criticized for leading to `` chalkiness '' in mixtures , and for allegedly decreasing the permanence of organic pigments mixed with it due to its high refractive index . \n Zinc white is less opaque and weaker in tinting strength than either titanium white or lead white . It is commonly used to lighten mixtures subtly while maintaining transparency . Although zinc white is the standard white in watercolors , its structural soundness in oils has been debated . Zinc white dries slowly and creates a relatively inflexible paint film . Critics of the pigment argue that its use leads to excessive cracking and delamination , even when used sparingly . \n In art , white lead paint is known as `` flake white '' or `` Cremnitz white '' . It is valued for the ease of handling and resilience the lead confers to oil paints . Lead white paint dries relatively quickly to form a strong , flexible paint film . Lead - based white is one of the oldest manufactured pigments . It was the only white pigment available to artists in appreciable quantities until the twentieth century , when zinc - white and titanium - white became available . Industrially produced lead white , the typical pigment from the 19th century until its ban , was thought to be inferior to traditionally fabricated forms , which had larger `` flake '' particles that conferred ease of handling . \n The dangers of lead paint were considered well - established by the beginning of the 20th century . In the July 1904 edition of its monthly publication , Sherwin - Williams reported the dangers of paint containing lead , noting that a French expert had deemed lead paint `` poisonous in a large degree , both for the workmen and for the inhabitants of a house painted with lead colors . '' As early as 1886 , German health laws prohibited women and children from working in factories processing lead paint and lead sugar . \n Lead paint is hazardous . It can cause nervous system damage , stunted growth , kidney damage , and delayed development . It is dangerous to children because it tastes sweet , therefore encouraging children to put lead chips and toys with lead dust in their mouths . Lead paint is dangerous to adults and can cause reproductive problems in men or women . Decreases in sperm production in men have been noted . Lead is considered a possible and likely carcinogen . High levels may result in death .",

    "context": "Although the `` Flight '' does not have a title in the score of the opera , its common English title translates like the Russian one ( Полёт шмеля = Polyot shmelya ) . Incidentally , this piece does not constitute one of the movements of the orchestral suite that Rimsky - Korsakov derived from the opera for concerts . \n Although the original orchestral version assigns portions of the sixteenth - note runs to various instruments in tandem , in the century since its composition the piece has become a standard showcase for solo instrumental virtuosity , whether on the original violin or on practically any other melodic instrument . Sergei Rachmaninov 's transcription for piano features in the film Shine and is interpreted by David Helfgott . \n The piece closes Act III , Tableau 1 , during which the magic Swan - Bird changes Prince Gvidon Saltanovich ( the Tsar 's son ) into an insect so that he can fly away to visit his father ( who does not know that he is alive ) . Although in the opera the Swan - Bird sings during the first part of the `` Flight '' , her vocal line is melodically uninvolved and easily omitted ; this feature , combined with the fact that the number decisively closes the scene , made easy extraction as an orchestral concerto piece possible . \n The music of this number recurs in modified form during the ensuing tableau ( Act III , Tableau 2 ) , at the points when the Bumblebee appears during the scene : it stings the two evil sisters on the brow , blinds Babarikha ( the instigator of the plot to trick Saltan at the beginning into sending his wife away ) , and in general causes havoc at the end of the tableau . The readers of Alexander Pushkin 's original poem , upon which this opera is based , will note that Gvidon is supposed to go on three separate trips to Saltan 's kingdom , each of which requires a transformation into a different insect . \n `` Flight of the Bumblebee '' is recognizable for its frantic pace when played up to tempo , with nearly uninterrupted runs of chromatic sixteenth notes . It is not so much the pitch or range of the notes that are played that challenges the musician , but simply the musician 's ability to move to them quickly enough . Because of this and its complexity , it requires a great deal of skill to perform . \n `` Flight of the Bumblebee '' is an orchestral interlude written by Nikolai Rimsky - Korsakov for his opera The Tale of Tsar Saltan , composed in 1899 -- 1900 . Its composition is intended to musically evoke the seemingly chaotic and rapidly changing flying pattern of a bumblebee . Despite the piece 's being a rather incidental part of the opera , it is today one of the more familiar classical works because of its frequent use in popular culture . \n Here is the text of the scene where the Swan - Bird sings during this music : \n Those familiar with the opera Tsar Saltan may recognize two leitmotifs used in the Flight , both of which are associated with Prince Gvidon from earlier in the opera . These are illustrated here in musical notation : \n In the `` Tsar Saltan '' suite , the short version is commonly played , taking less than two minutes . In the Opera version , the three - minute fifty - five - second version is performed .",

    "gold": "Publius Horatius Cocles",
    "answers": "",
    "context": "Livy viewed the story as legendary ; that is , he repeated accounts that he had read unable to vouch for their authority . Livy found the swimming event hard to believe , quipping `` though many missiles fell over him he swam across in safety to his friends , an act of daring more famous than credible with posterity . '' Florus has something similar to say : `` It was on this occasion that those three prodigies and marvels of Rome made their appearance , Horatius , Mucius and Cloelia , who , were they not recorded in our annals , would seem fabulous characters at the present day . '' \n Perceiving the danger , three officers ( of noble rank ) stood shoulder - to - shoulder to allow their own troops to pass and block the passage of the enemy : Spurius Lartius and Titus Herminius Aquilinus , commanders of the right wing ( equivalent to colonels or lieutenant generals ) , and Publius Horatius , a more junior officer of unspecified rank . He was a patrician , and the nephew of consul Marcus Horatius Pulvillus and had lost an eye in a previous battle ( hence his agnomen `` Cocles '' ) . He was also said to have been a descendant of one of the Horatii who had fought the Curiatii of Alba Longa . Livy defines his station in the defense as `` on guard at the bridge when he saw the Janiculum taken by a sudden assault and the enemy rushing down from it to the river ... '' The three defenders of the bridge withstood sword and missile attacks until the troops had all crossed . \n To account for his presence in numerous histories T.J. Cornell further presumes that they relied on `` unscrupulous annalists '' who `` did not hesitate to invent a series of face - saving victories in the immediate aftermath of these defeats '' such as the presumed defeat of Rome at the Naevian Meadow . Furthermore , `` The annalists of the first century BC are thus seen principally as entertainers ... '' \n Although the story appears in many different credible ancient sources , such as Plutarch , Dionysius of Halicarnassus , and Livy , with variations , many historians have been skeptical of the story . \n In the 1983 action film Blue Thunder the reference is made after a television executive sees an incriminating video of , `` ( cops and feds ) stirring up the barrio to prove what ( Blue Thunder ) can do . '' Blue Thunder 's pilot , Frank Murphy , accused of being a rogue officer by the media is likened to Horatius Cocles by the television executive , `` That cop up there may be the hottest ticket since Horatius at the bridge , '' alluding to Frank Murphy 's sacrifice of himself and the ultra-assault / surveillance helicopter for the public 's right to know of government spying tactics on the people of Los Angeles . \n The story is retold in Horatius from the Lays of Ancient Rome by Lord Macaulay , a poem of great popularity in the late nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century . Being still well - known today it appears at least in part in the curricula of some secondary schools . The details of the poem often vary from the traditional tale by poetic license . A reference from the book appears also in the 2013 film Oblivion with the quote : `` And how can a man die better , than facing fearful odds , for the ashes of his fathers , and the temples of his gods . '' \n The story of Horatius at the bridge began to be depicted in art in the Renaissance , but was never popular . It tended to be shown by artists who favoured recondite classical stories , and appear in the minor arts , such as plaquettes and maiolica . \n Horatius ' action at the bridge halted the Etruscan attack and forced Lars Porsena to engage in a protracted siege of Rome rather than sacking it outright , which was later concluded by peace treaty with the city intact . \n Publius Horatius Cocles was an officer in the army of the ancient Roman Republic who famously defended the Pons Sublicius from the invading army of Lars Porsena , king of Clusium in the late 6th century BC , during the war between Rome and Clusium . \n Winston Churchill recorded that while he `` stagnated in the lowest form '' at Harrow , he gained a prize open to the whole school by reciting the whole twelve hundred lines of Macaulay 's poem . A biographical film about Churchill , Into the Storm ( 2009 ) , begins with the much older Churchill reciting from Horatius . Later in the film , the same verses feature prominently in a nostalgic and morose address Churchill delivers to his war cabinet . Churchill also recites a brief section to himself in a scene in the biographical film Darkest Hour ( 2017 ) . \n `` A Nation Once Again '' is an Irish rebel song , written in the early to mid-1840s by Thomas Osborne Davis ( 1814 -- 1845 ) to further the cause of Irish nationalism . First published in The Nation on 13 July 1844 ( two years after Macaulay 's `` Horatius '' ) , it quickly became a rallying call for the growing Irish nationalist movement at that time . The first verse refers to the heroism of `` ancient freemen , / For Greece and Rome who bravely stood , / three hundred men and three men '' , which are apparent references to the last stand of the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae and the heroic stand of Horatius and his two companions at the bridge . \n Polybius ' brief notice of the story uses Horatius as an example of the men who have `` devoted themselves to inevitable death ... to save the lives of other citizens ... he threw himself into the river with his armor , and there lost his life as he had designed . '' Though Horatius did not perish in the river , the disability he suffered ( and subsequent honorable discharge from the army ) ended the life he had previously pursued . \n The French general Thomas - Alexandre Dumas was given the title ' The Horatius Cocles of Tyrol ' by Napoleon after the battle of Klausen , where he defended a bridge over the River Eisack alone for several crucial minutes . \n The two lines closed . After a `` considerable time '' , Valerius and Lucretius having been carried wounded off the field in full view of the troops , the army was struck by a panic and ran for the bridge . The enemy effected a slaughter at first among the troops milling around at the entrance to the bridge but then began to mingle with them in hope of crossing . \n Tacitus mentions in passing that Porsena , `` when the city was surrendered , did not violate the seat of Jupiter '' ( the Capitol ) . This could mean that perhaps Rome surrendered during or after the battle . \n Wounded as he was Horatius was honorably crowned and conducted into the city by a singing crowd while the populace streamed into the streets to see him . A bronze statue was later erected to him in the comitium because of his heroic act ; he was given `` as much of the public land as he himself could plow around in one day with a yoke of oxen . '' Every citizen of Rome gave him one day 's ration of food , although Dionysius of Halicarnassus does not explain what logistically such a contribution should mean and how and when it was delivered . Horatius was now disabled and could not by law remain in the army or hold public office . \n Dionysius goes on to say , `` Herminius and Lartius , their defensive arms being now rendered useless by the continual blows they received , began to retreat gradually . '' They called on Horatius to retreat but perceiving the tactical difficulty of allowing the enemy to cross he stood his ground , directing them to tell the consuls to tear up the bridge . The enemy view of him as a madman determined to commit suicide taking them with him protected him to some extent , as did his taking refuge behind the pile of slain . He returned enemy missiles . Finally wounded all over and having received a spear in the buttocks he heard a shout from the other bank that the bridge was torn up . He `` leaped with his arms into the river and swimming across ... he emerged upon the shore without having lost any of his arms . '' Livy 's version has him uttering this prayer : `` Tiberinus , holy father , I pray thee to receive into thy propitious stream these arms and this thy warrior , '' which is not inconsistent with Roman beliefs in the genius of a place . \n In the abbreviated ( one section ) and skeptical version of Livy , no battle took place , but `` his own men , a panic - struck mob , were deserting their posts and throwing away their arms '' . Apparently Rome had placed its defense in the hands of an entire army of cowards , which not only could not hold one hill but after drawing up a line of battle could not stand even the first charge of the enemy . Cocles , in this view , was the only man in the entire army with the courage to stand up , motivating two veteran generals only through a sense of shame to assist him momentarily . Livy gives no clue as to what such men were doing on the field in the first place and , though finding Cocles ' feats incredible , apparently sees no contradiction between the rank , experience and character of the generals and their supposed behavior on the field . \n The poem of Sven Dufva in The Tales of Ensign Stål tells the story of a simple - minded but honest and dutiful soldier in the Finnish War who by himself heroically holds back an attack by Russian forces at a bridge but dies in the effort . \n In 509 BC , the army of Clusium marched on Rome and attacked the city . Concentrating his forces on the Etruscan side of the Tiber , Porsena assaulted the Janiculum and took it from the terrified Roman recruits with all its stores . An Etruscan garrison was detailed to hold it . Porsena 's army made for the Pons Sublicius , but found there a Roman line of battle across the bend of the river . Porsena drew up a line of battle opposite it , apparently without hindrance , relying on numerical superiority to cow the Romans . The Tarquins commanded the Etruscan left wing facing the troops of Spurius Lartius and Titus Herminius . Octavius Mamilius took the Etruscan right commanding rebel Latins , facing Marcus Valerius Volusus and Titus Lucretius Tricipitinus . Porsena commanded the Etruscan center , facing the two consuls .",

    "context": "An ignition coil consists of a laminated iron core surrounded by two coils of copper wire . Unlike a power transformer , an ignition coil has an open magnetic circuit -- the iron core does not form a closed loop around the windings . The energy that is stored in the magnetic field of the core is the energy that is transferred to the spark plug . \n In a coil meant for a dual - spark system , the secondary winding has two terminals isolated from the primary , and each terminal connects to a spark plug . With this system , no extra diode is needed since there would be no fuel - air mixture present at the inactive spark plug . \n Ignition systems are not required for diesel engines which rely on compression to ignite the fuel / air mixture . \n In older vehicles , a single coil would serve all the spark plugs via the ignition distributor . Notable exceptions are the Saab 92 , some Volkswagens , and the Wartburg 353 which have one ignition coil per cylinder . The flat twin cylinder 1948 Citroën 2CV used one double ended coil without a distributor , and just contact breakers , in a wasted spark system . \n An ignition coil ( also called a spark coil ) is an induction coil in an automobile 's ignition system that transforms the battery 's low voltage to the thousands of volts needed to create an electric spark in the spark plugs to ignite the fuel . Some coils have an internal resistor , while others rely on a resistor wire or an external resistor to limit the current flowing into the coil from the car 's 12 - volt supply . The wire that goes from the ignition coil to the distributor and the high voltage wires that go from the distributor to each of the spark plugs are called spark plug wires or high tension leads . Originally , every ignition coil system required mechanical contact breaker points and a capacitor ( condenser ) . More recent electronic ignition systems use a power transistor to provide pulses to the ignition coil . A modern passenger automobile may use one ignition coil for each engine cylinder ( or pair of cylinders ) , eliminating fault - prone spark plug cables and a distributor to route the high voltage pulses . \n Formerly , ignition coils were made with varnish and paper insulated high - voltage windings , inserted into a drawn - steel can and filled with oil or asphalt for insulation and moisture protection . Coils on modern automobiles are cast in filled epoxy resins which penetrate any voids within the winding . \n The amount of energy in the spark required to ignite the air - fuel mixture varies depending on the pressure and composition of the mixture , and on the speed of the engine . Under laboratory conditions as little as 1 millijoule is required in each spark , but practical coils must deliver much more energy than this to allow for higher pressure , rich or lean mixtures , losses in ignition wiring , and plug fouling and leakage . When gas velocity is high in the spark gap , the arc between the terminals is blown away from the terminals , making the arc longer and requiring more energy in each spark . Between 30 and 70 milli - joules are delivered in each spark . \n A single - spark system has one coil per spark plug . To prevent premature sparking at the start of the primary pulse , a diode or secondary spark gap is installed in the coil to block the reverse pulse that would otherwise form . \n In modern systems , the distributor is omitted and ignition is instead electronically controlled . Much smaller coils are used with one coil for each spark plug or one coil serving two spark plugs ( for example two coils in a four - cylinder engine , or three coils in a six - cylinder engine ) . A large ignition coil puts out about 40 kV , and a small one such as from a lawn mower puts out about 15 kV . These coils may be remotely mounted or they may be placed on top of the spark plug ( coil - on - plug or Direct Ignition ) . Where one coil serves two spark plugs ( in two cylinders ) , it is through the `` wasted spark '' system . In this arrangement , the coil generates two sparks per cycle to both cylinders . The fuel in the cylinder that is nearing the end of its compression stroke is ignited , whereas the spark in its companion that is nearing the end of its exhaust stroke has no effect . The wasted spark system is more reliable than a single coil system with a distributor and less expensive than coil - on - plug . \n Where coils are individually applied per cylinder , they may all be contained in a single molded block with multiple high - tension terminals . This is commonly called a coil - pack . \n In a low - inductance coil , fewer primary turns are used , so primary current is higher . This is not compatible with the capacity of mechanical breaker points , so solid - state switching is used . \n The primary winding has relatively few turns of heavy wire . The secondary winding consists of thousands of turns of smaller wire , insulated from the high voltage by enamel on the wires and layers of oiled paper insulation . The coil is usually inserted into a metal can or plastic case with insulated terminals for the high voltage and low voltage connections . When the contact breaker closes , it allows current from the battery to flow through the primary winding of the ignition coil . The current does not flow instantly because of the inductance of the coil . Current flowing in the coil produces a magnetic field in the core and in the air surrounding the core . The current must flow long enough to store enough energy in the field for the spark . Once the current has built up to its full level , the contact breaker opens . Since it has a capacitor connected across it , the primary winding and the capacitor form a tuned circuit , and as the stored energy oscillates between the inductor formed by the coil and the capacitor , the changing magnetic field in the core of the coil induces a much larger voltage in the secondary of the coil . More modern electronic ignition systems operate on exactly the same principle , but some rely on charging the capacitor to around 400 volts rather than charging the inductance of the coil . The timing of the opening of the contacts ( or switching of the transistor ) must be matched to the position of the piston in the cylinder so that the spark may be timed to ignite the air / fuel mixture to extract the most angular momentum possible . This is usually several degrees before the piston reaches top dead center . The contacts are driven off a shaft that is driven by the engine camshaft , or , if electronic ignition is used , a sensor on the engine shaft controls the timing of the pulses . \n Early gasoline ( petrol ) internal combustion engines used a magneto ignition system , since no battery was fitted to the vehicle ; magnetos are still used in piston - engine aircraft to keep the engine running in the event of an electrical failure . The voltage produced by a magneto is dependent on the speed of the engine , making starting difficult . A battery - operated coil can provide a high - voltage spark even at low speeds , making starting easier . When batteries became common in automobiles for cranking and lighting , the ignition coil system displaced magneto ignition . \n A bad coil pack may cause a misfire , bad fuel consumption or loss of power .",

    "context": "Actors who have portrayed Huckleberry Finn in movies and TV : \n Huckleberry `` Huck '' Finn is a fictional character created by Mark Twain who first appeared in the book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and is the protagonist and narrator of its sequel , Adventures of Huckleberry Finn . He is 12 or 13 years old during the former and a year older ( `` thirteen or fourteen or along there , '' Chapter 17 ) at the time of the latter . Huck also narrates Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer , Detective , two shorter sequels to the first two books . \n Tom 's Aunt Polly calls Huck a `` poor motherless thing . '' Huck confesses to Tom in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer that he remembers his mother and his parents ' relentless fighting that only abated with her death . \n Huck has a carefree life free from societal norms or rules , stealing watermelons and chickens and `` borrowing '' boats and cigars . Due to his unconventional childhood , Huck has received almost no education . At the end of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer , Huck is adopted by the Widow Douglas , who sends him to school in return for his saving her life . In the course of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn he learns enough to be literate and even reads books for entertainment when there is n't anything else to do . His knowledge of history as related to Jim is wildly inaccurate , but it is not specified if he is being wrong on purpose as a joke on Jim . \n In the end , however , Jim gains his freedom through Miss Watson 's death , as she freed him in her will . Pap , it is revealed , has died in Huck 's absence , and although he could safely return to St. Petersburg , Huck plans to flee west to Indian Territory . \n In Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer , Detective , the sequels to Huck Finn , however , Huck is living in St. Petersburg again after the events of his eponymous novel . In Abroad , Huck joins Tom and Jim for a wild , fanciful balloon ride that takes them overseas . In Detective , which occurs about a year after the events of Huck Finn , Huck helps Tom solve a murder mystery . \n His appearance is described in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer . He wears the clothes of full - grown men which he probably received as charity , and as Twain describes him , `` he was fluttering with rags . '' He has a torn broken hat and his trousers are supported with only one suspender . \n Jim , a runaway slave whom Huck befriends , is another dominant force in Huck 's life . He is the symbol for the moral awakening Huck undergoes throughout Adventures of Huckleberry Finn . This is seen when Huck considers sending a letter to Ms. Watson telling her where Jim is but ultimately chooses to rip it up despite the idea in the south that one who tries helping a slave escape will be sent to eternal punishment . \n Huckleberry `` Huck '' Finn is the son of the town 's vagrant drunkard , `` Pap '' Finn . Sleeping on doorsteps when the weather is fair , in empty hogsheads during storms , and living off of what he receives from others , Huck lives the life of a destitute vagabond . The author metaphorically names him `` the juvenile pariah of the village '' and describes Huck as `` idle , and lawless , and vulgar , and bad , '' qualities for which he was admired by all the children in the village , although their mothers `` cordially hated and dreaded '' him . \n Jim is running away because he overheard Miss Watson planning to `` sell him South '' for eight hundred dollars . Jim wants to escape to Ohio , where he can find work to eventually buy his family 's freedom . Huck and Jim take a raft down the Mississippi River in hopes of finding freedom from slavery for Jim and freedom from Pap for Huck . Their adventures together , along with Huck 's solo adventures , comprise the core of the book . \n Pap Finn is Huck 's abusive , drunken father who shows up at the beginning of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and forcibly takes his son to live with him . Pap 's only method of parenting is physical abuse . Although he seems derisive of education and civilized living , Pap seems to be jealous of Huck and is infuriated that his son would try to amount to more , and live in better conditions than he did . Despite this , early in the novel Huck uses his father 's method of `` borrowing '' though he later feels sorry and stops . \n In Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , the sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer , the Widow attempts to `` sivilize '' ( sic ) the newly wealthy Huck . Huck 's father takes him from her , but Huck manages to fake his own death and escape to Jackson 's Island , where he coincidentally meets up with Jim , a slave who was owned by the Widow Douglas ' sister , Miss Watson . \n The character of Huck Finn is based on Tom Blankenship , the real - life son of a sawmill laborer and sometime drunkard named Woodson Blankenship , who lived in a `` ramshackle '' house near the Mississippi River behind the house where the author grew up in Hannibal , Missouri . The father of Huck , called `` Pap '' Finn , may be based on Jimmy Finn , a full - blown alcoholic who lived on the streets , and it is only through Twain 's remembrances that Woodson is characterized as a drunkard . Twain left Hannibal and his boyhood at an early age and his memories of these people are colored by what he could have known and understood at the time , as a boy of less than 14 years old . Twain 's friend Tom Blankenship did n't attend school because there were no public schools at the time , and his family was too poor to send him to a private school . Left at loose ends in a busy household with six sisters and lacking a mother who seems to have died when he was young , this Tom was indeed `` at liberty '' most of the time . \n Huck is an archetypal innocent , able to discover the `` right '' thing to do despite the prevailing theology and prejudiced mentality of the South of that era . The best example of this is his decision to help Jim escape slavery , even though he believes he will go to hell for it ( see Christian views on slavery ) . \n Twain mentions his childhood friend Tom Blankenship as the inspiration for creating Huckleberry Finn in his autobiography : `` In Huckleberry Finn I have drawn Tom Blankenship exactly as he was . He was ignorant , unwashed , insufficiently fed ; but he had as good a heart as ever any boy had . His liberties were totally unrestricted . He was the only really independent person -- boy or man -- in the community , and by consequence he was tranquilly and continuously happy and envied by the rest of us . And as his society was forbidden us by our parents the prohibition trebled and quadrupled its value , and therefore we sought and got more of his society than any other boy 's . '' -- Mark Twain 's Autobiography . \n Since Mark Twain 's death , Huck Finn has also appeared in a number of novels , plays , and stories written by various authors that purport to tell the latter adventures of Huck and his friends . \n Huck is Tom Sawyer 's closest friend . Their friendship is partially rooted in Sawyer 's emulation of Huck 's freedom and ability to do what he wants , like swearing and smoking when he feels like it . In one moment in the novel , he openly brags to his teacher that he was late for school because he stopped to talk with Huck Finn and enjoyed it , something for which he knew he would ( and did ) receive a whipping . Nonetheless , Tom remains a devoted friend to Huck in all of the novels they appear in . In Huckleberry Finn , it 's revealed that Huck also considers Tom to be his best friend . At various times in the novel , Huck mentions that Tom would put more `` style '' in Jim and his adventure .",

    "context": "The man who was hit by the truck contacts his insurance company , and is visited by Shazia ( Kiran Sonia Sawar ) , an investigator . Her job is to use a device known as a Recaller to scan a claimant 's and any witnesses ' memories and verify the claim ; despite memory being acknowledged as unreliable , it is a legal requirement to submit to a Recaller scan . Shazia follows a chain of witnesses near the accident without determining liability as none had witnessed it directly , but one witness 's memories show Mia looking out of her hotel room window at the time of the accident . Shazia is hopeful that Mia 's testimony will allow her to prove the case -- which would also allow the insurance company to pursue a lucrative negligence suit against the owners of the pizza truck . \n The episode was shot in Iceland and includes scenes filmed in the Harpa concert hall . Brooker had originally called out for filming in Scotland in his script , but Netflix suggested Iceland as a `` more stunning backdrop '' , according to Brooker . During filming , Iceland had its largest snowfall in forty years , which required them to add one line of dialogue to comment on the change of weather to account for the sudden snow accumulation . \n Whilst series one and two of Black Mirror were shown on Channel 4 in the UK , in September 2015 Netflix commissioned the series for 12 episodes , and in March 2016 it outbid Channel 4 for the rights to distributing the third series , with a bid of $40 million . The 12 episode order was divided into two series of six episodes each . \n The episode received mixed reviews . The cinematography of the Icelandic landscape was widely praised , along with Riseborough 's and Sawar 's performances . Two critics criticised the violence and described it as unnecessarily bleak . \n In May 2017 , a Reddit post unofficially announced the names and directors of the six episodes in series 4 of Black Mirror . The first trailer for the series was released by Netflix on 25 August 2017 , and contained the six episode titles . \n At the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018 , Toyota announced its customisable self - driving delivery vehicle , the e-Palette , with one of their first partners being Pizza Hut to create a self - driving pizza delivery truck . Commentators pointed out the coincidence of this announcement short after the first broadcast of `` Crocodile '' , and the official Twitter account for Black Mirror commented on the announcement , `` We know how that goes . '' \n The episode was inspired by the series one episode , `` The Entire History of You '' , which featured a personal implant that one could use privately to review their memories . For `` Crocodile '' , they considered what the situation would be like if these memories were not private , developing a `` cat - and - mouse type drama '' that would highlight the importance of memories , and to what lengths one with a secret would go to to hide those memories . \n Filmed in Iceland , the episode centres on Mia ( Andrea Riseborough ) who is distressed about having helped her friend Rob ( Andrew Gower ) cover up a hit - and - run death . Fifteen years later , Rob wants to confess their crime , leading Mia to kill him and dispose of his body . Shortly after , Mia witnesses a road accident between a pedestrian and self - driving vehicle . Shazia ( Kiran Sonia Sawar ) meanwhile is hired to investigate the accident , and uses a Recaller device that allows her to see the recent memories of those she interviews . \n Beginning on 24 November 2017 , Netflix published a series of posters and trailers for the fourth series of the show , referred to as the `` 13 Days of Black Mirror '' . On 6 December , Netflix published a trailer featuring an amalgamation of scenes from the fourth series , which announced that the series would be released on 29 December . \n The episode was initially conceived as having a male protagonist with Andrea Riseborough reading the script with another part in mind . However , after Riseborough liked the journey of the protagonist and asked if the part could be rewritten as a woman , the script was altered in order to accommodate Riseborough . Both Brooker and executive producer Annabel Jones described the change as interesting , with Jones noting that `` How often do you see a mother reduced to this level of desperation ? '' on television . \n `` Crocodile '' is the third episode of the fourth series of anthology series Black Mirror . It was written by Charlie Brooker and directed by John Hillcoat . The episode first aired on Netflix , along with the rest of series four , on 29 December 2017 . \n Police investigating the murders reveal that Shazia 's son was blind and would have been unable to identify the killer ; they instead use the Recaller on the family guinea pig to dredge its memories for evidence . Meanwhile , Mia cries in the audience as she watches her son 's school production of Bugsy Malone ; the audience begins to clap . The police are seen waiting at the back of the auditorium . As the camera continues lingering on Mia , in tears , the screen abruptly cuts to black . \n Some critics have suggested that the title is a reference to the metaphor `` crocodile tears '' , a phrase that could be referring to Mia 's insincere expressions of sorrow while committing a series of violent crimes . Jason Koebler of Vice notes that Mia does not read the End - User License Agreement ( EULA ) for the Recaller . Koebler suggests that Mia reading the EULA would have allowed her to avoid using the Recaller , and thus prevent her later murders from being necessary . \n Fifteen years later , Mia is happily married and has a son and successful career . When she goes on a business trip , Rob meets her at her hotel . He shows her a news article about the dead cyclist , whose wife believes him to be alive and is still looking for him . Rob wants to write an anonymous letter telling the truth , but Mia is afraid the letter will be traced . An argument ensues and she kills Rob . She is further shaken upon seeing a road accident outside , where a self - driving pizza delivery truck has hit a pedestrian . Mia rents a pay per view porn movie to provide herself with an alibi , before disposing of Rob 's body . \n Mia Nolan ( Andrea Riseborough ) and Rob ( Andrew Gower ) go to a club together . Whilst driving home , Rob hits and kills a cyclist on a mountain road . He convinces Mia to help him cover up the death by throwing the cyclist 's body and bicycle into a lake . \n Mia admits to witnessing the accident , and initially refuses to let Shazia in her house , but eventually relents after being reminded about the legal requirement . Shazia mistakes Mia 's reluctance as being due to embarrassment over watching a porn movie , and assures her that she is not interested in her personal activities . Mia tries to prepare her mind to focus away from Rob 's murder before Shazia uses the Recaller on her , but she can not stop memories of both homicides coming forward during the scan . Recognizing what she has seen , Shazia tries to leave , but Mia incapacitates her and ties her up . Shazia promises that she will delete the Recaller data and will not tell anyone what happened if Mia lets her go , but Mia believes she will be incriminated . Mia scans Shazia 's memories with the Recaller to learn that her husband Anan knew Shazia was going to see Mia that day . Mia kills Shazia and drives to her home to kill Anan . Upon realising that Shazia 's baby son is also in the house and has seen her face , Mia reluctantly kills him too .",

    "context": "In the late 17th century during the `` Little Ice Age '' there are reports of severe winter ice in the Strait of Dover , including a case in 1684 of only a league of open water remaining between Dover and Calais. ; see ( 1 ) for another report of severe ice in the English Channel . \n The town of Dover gives its name to one of the sea areas of the British Shipping Forecast . \n Most maritime traffic between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea and Baltic Sea passes through the Strait of Dover , rather than taking the longer and more dangerous route around the north of Scotland . The strait is the busiest international seaway in the world , used by over 400 commercial vessels daily . This has made traffic safety a critical issue , with HM Coastguard and the Maritime Gendarmerie maintaining a 24 - hour watch over the strait and enforcing a strict regime of shipping lanes . \n The submarine depth of the strait varies between 68 m ( 223 ft ) at the Lobourg strait and 20 m ( 66 ft ) at the highest banks . It presents a succession of rocky areas relatively deserted by ships wanting to spare their nets , and of sandy flats and sub-aqueous dunes . The strong currents of the Channel are slowed down around the rocky areas of the strait , with formation of countercurrents and calmer zones where many species can find shelter . In these calmer zones , the water is clearer than in the rest of the strait ; thus algae can grow despite the 30 m ( 98 ft ) average depth and help increase diversity in the local species -- some of which are endemic to the strait . Moreover , this is a transition zone for the species of the Atlantic Ocean and those of the southern part of the North Sea . \n In addition to the intensive east -- west traffic , the strait is crossed from north to south by ferries linking Dover to Calais and Dunkirk . Until 1994 these provided the only route across it for land transport . The Channel Tunnel now provides an alternative route , crossing beneath the strait at an average depth of 45 m ( 148 ft ) below the seabed . \n The Rhine ( as the Urstrom ) flowed northwards into the North Sea as the sea level fell during the start of the first of the Pleistocene Ice Ages . The ice created a dam from Scandinavia to Scotland , and the Rhine , combined with the Thames and drainage from much of north Europe , created a vast lake behind the dam , which eventually spilled over the Weald into the English Channel . This overflow channel became the Strait of Dover about 425,000 years ago . A narrow deep channel along the middle of the strait was the bed of the Rhine in the last Ice Age . A geological deposit in East Anglia marks the old preglacial northward course of the Rhine . \n A 682 km ( 263 sq mi ) area of the strait is classified as a Natura 2000 protection zone listed under the name Ridens et dunes hydrauliques du Pas de Calais ( Ridens and sub-aqueous dunes of the Dover Strait ) . This area includes the sub-aqueous dunes of Varne , Colbart , Vergoyer and Bassurelle , the Ridens de Boulogne , and the Lobourg channel which provides calmer and clearer waters due to its depth reaching 68 m ( 223 ft ) . \n Many crossings other than in conventional vessels have been attempted , including by pedalo , jetpack , bathtub , amphibious vehicle and more commonly by swimming . French law bans many of these while English law does not , so most such crossings originate in England . \n A 2007 study concluded the English Channel was formed by erosion caused by two major floods . The first was about 425,000 years ago , when an ice - dammed lake in the southern North Sea overflowed and broke the Weald - Artois chalk range in a catastrophic erosion and flood event . Afterwards , the Thames and Scheldt flowed through the gap into the English Channel , but the Meuse and Rhine still flowed northwards . In a second flood about 225,000 years ago the Meuse and Rhine were ice - dammed into a lake that broke catastrophically through a high weak barrier ( perhaps chalk , or an end - moraine left by the ice sheet ) . Both floods cut massive flood channels in the dry bed of the English Channel , somewhat like the Channeled Scablands or the Wabash River in the USA . A further update in 2017 , attributed a series of previously described underwater holes in the Channel floor - `` 100m deep '' and in places `` several kilometres in diameter '' to lake water plunging over a rock ridge causing isolated depressions or plunge pools . The melting ice and rising sea levels submerged Doggerland , the area linking Britain to France 6,500 -- 6,200 BCE . \n This mix of various environments promotes a wide variety of wildlife . \n The Lobourg strait , a major feature of the strait 's seafloor , runs its 6 km ( 4 mi ) wide slash on a NNE -- SSW axis . Nearer to the French coast than to the English coast , it runs along the Varne sandbank where it plunges to 68 m ( 223 ft ) at its deepest , and along the latter 's south - east neighbour the Ridge bank ( French name `` Colbart '' ) with a maximum depth of 62 m ( 203 ft ) . \n On a clear day , it is possible to see the opposite coastline of England from France and vice versa with the naked eye , with the most famous and obvious sight being the white cliffs of Dover from the French coastline and shoreline buildings on both coastlines , as well as lights on either coastline at night , as in Matthew Arnold 's poem `` Dover Beach '' . \n The strait is believed to have been created by the erosion of a land bridge that linked the Weald in Great Britain to the Boulonnais in the Pas de Calais . The predominant geology on both the British and French sides and on the seafloor is chalk . Although somewhat resistant to erosion , erosion of both coasts has created the famous white cliffs of Dover in the UK and the Cap Blanc Nez in France . The Channel Tunnel was bored through solid chalk . \n The Ridens de Boulogne , a 10 -- 20 m ( 33 -- 66 ft ) deep rocky high ground partially covered with sand located 15 nmi ( 28 km ; 17 mi ) to the west of Boulogne , boasts the highest production of maerl in the strait . \n The Strait of Dover or Dover Strait , historically known as the Dover Narrows ( French : pas de Calais ( pɑ d ( ə ) ‿ kalɛ ) , `` Strait of Calais '' ; Dutch : Nauw van Kales ( nʌu̯ vɑn kaːˈlɛː ) or Straat van Dover ) , is the strait at the narrowest part of the English Channel , marking the boundary between the Channel and North Sea , separating Great Britain from continental Europe . The shortest distance across the strait , 33.3 kilometres ( 20.7 miles ; 18.0 nautical miles ) , is from the South Foreland , northeast of Dover in the English county of Kent , to Cap Gris Nez , a cape near to Calais in the French département of Pas - de-Calais . Between these points lies the most popular route for cross-channel swimmers . The entire strait is within the territorial waters of France and the United Kingdom , but a right of transit passage under the UNCLOS exists allowing unrestricted shipping .",

    "gold": "generally either the punter or the backup quarterback",
    "answers": "",
    "context": "Given the trivial nature of the position , no award for holders existed until 2015 when Peter Mortell , then a senior punter and holder for the Minnesota Golden Gophers and known for his humor , created a tongue - in - cheek `` Holder of the Year '' Award for the best holder in college football , named it after himself , and made himself its first recipient . ESPN recognized the award at their yearly ESPY Awards ceremony ( alongside more serious , major position awards ) , with Mortell accepting via pre-recorded video . The award subsequently continued and was awarded in 2016 to senior quarterback / holder Garrett Moores of Michigan . In 2017 , the award was given to Connor McGinnis of Oklahoma . \n Oakland Raiders -- The Raiders ' Matt Schaub was used as the holder during the 2014 season . \n In today 's NFL , most teams use their punter as holder . New England Patriots ' head coach Bill Belichick explained that punters are generally holders for the reason that punters and kickers usually have more time together to game plan , watch film , and are able to have more reps during practice than a player who has to play another position . \n Having the backup quarterback play as the holder has faded out in the NFL , mainly due to a rule in the NFL 's collective bargaining agreement that prohibited a team 's third - string quarterback from playing except in emergencies ( this was repealed in the 2011 CBA , but since that time , most NFL teams have only carried two quarterbacks on the active roster ) . However , such usage has remained rather common in collegiate football . Many times a quarterback who was a redshirt freshman will serve as the holder his sophomore year . It is also common in other professional leagues such as the Arena Football League ( where there is no punting and are thus no punters ) or the Canadian Football League , where roster size restrictions generally result in one person serving as both placekicker and punter . \n There are a few NFL teams that still use a quarterback as their holders . \n Seattle Seahawks -- Steve Largent , a wide receiver , was the kick holder and in 1985 , he ran in a muffed snap for an extra point . \n There can also be a holder during kickoffs and free kicks , but this is reserved for when the ball tee can not keep the ball up by itself , usually due to wind . In such a case , the holder can be of any position and , because kickoffs involve a much higher risk of being involved in a tackling play , is usually a defensive player of some sort . \n The holder 's actual position , on the team 's official depth chart , is generally either the punter or the backup quarterback . Some high school football teams will place a wide receiver or running back at the holder position because of their good hands ( this is not unheard of at other levels ; Steve Tasker , a wide receiver and punt gunner , also played holder at various times in his NFL career , as does his son Luke Tasker , also a wide receiver ) . \n The rationale for having a backup quarterback holding is that the quarterback is accustomed to receiving snaps from center and long snaps from the shotgun formation . He also provides a threat for a fake field goal since the quarterback can throw a pass on such plays . Additionally , in the event of a bad snap and an aborted kick attempt , the holder might have to become the quarterback for the play , so having an actual quarterback helps in that regard . Years ago in the NFL , backup quarterbacks generally held for field goal kicks . \n During a `` fake field goal '' attempt the holder may pick the ball up and either throw a forward pass or run with the ball ( i.e. , act as the quarterback would on a standard play ) . In addition , the holder may attempt a run or pass if the snap is botched and a successful kick is unlikely . However , this rarely succeeds ; the holder is usually tackled promptly . \n Compared to other American football positions , the holder is one of the most trivial positions , requiring precision in the receipt of a snap and placement of a ball in short time , but requiring far less physical talent than a skill position and much less bulk or strength than a lineman . Because of this , it is exceptionally rare for a team to preserve a roster spot solely for a placekick holder ; most teams will instead use a player who plays another position to double as the holder . One notable exception was Patricia Palinkas , the first female professional football player ; Palinkas played holder ( and no other position ) during her short time as a pro player . \n Denver Broncos -- The Broncos used to have former starting quarterback Jake Plummer as the holder and continued to do so after he was benched in favor of Jay Cutler . After Plummer retired the Broncos began to use their punter as the holder . \n Washington Redskins -- Starting quarterback Joe Theismann held for Mark Moseley from the late 1970s until he suffered his career - ending broken leg during a 1985 Monday Night Football game vs. the New York Giants . \n In American football and Canadian football , the holder is the player who receives the snap from the long snapper during field goal or extra point attempts made by the placekicker . The holder is set on one knee five yards behind the line - of - scrimmage . Before the play begins he places the hand which is closest to the place kicker on the ground in a location designated by the kickers foot ( In high school games , the holder / kicker combo is responsible for a kicking block , which lifts the ball off the turf ) , with his forward hand ready to receive the snap . After receiving the snap , the holder will place the football on the turf , or block , ideally with the laces facing the uprights and the ball accurately placed where the back hand was initially , then balancing the ball with one or two fingers until the ball is kicked . \n Dallas Cowboys -- When Tony Romo was signed by the Dallas Cowboys , he was their backup quarterback , and as the backup quarterback , part of his job was to be the team 's holder . Romo was replaced by the punter in 2010 , but due to many mishandled snaps , which resulted in missed field goals , Romo returned as the team 's official holder . The Cowboys hired a more experienced holder , Brian Moorman , in 2012 ; Moorman left the team at the end of the season . Throughout the 1990s , starting tight end Jay Novacek was the usual holder on kicks . \n The holder , like the placekicker and the long snapper , is protected from intentional contact from the opposing team . The penalty for roughing the holder is 15 yards and an automatic first down . \n New Orleans Saints -- The Saints tend to run more fake field goals than any other team , and due to that they generally keep a backup in as their holder ( this keeps opposing defenses in more of a zone coverage , and also helps to prevent blocked field goals ) . Their holder for a period was quarterback Luke McCown , but is now punter Thomas Morstead .",

    "context": "King Ezekiel is a fictional character from the comic book series The Walking Dead and the television series of the same name , where he is portrayed by Khary Payton . \n Ezekiel ( referred to as `` King Ezekiel '' by his fellow citizens ) is the leader of a community known as the Kingdom . Ezekiel was formerly a zookeeper and has known his pet tiger , Shiva , since she was born . \n Ezekiel is portrayed by Khary Payton on The Walking Dead television series , beginning with the seventh season . Ezekiel and his pet tiger Shiva were introduced in the seasons trailer at the 2016 San Diego Comic - Con . \n Ezekiel is first introduced to the series in the episode `` The Well '' , when Morgan Jones and Carol are brought to the Kingdom by his people to give medical attention to Carol . When Carol awakens , Morgan introduces her to Ezekiel and his pet Bengal tiger Shiva . Ezekiel 's quasi-Shakespearean manner of ruling leaves Carol quietly incredulous . When Ezekiel asks what she thinks of his sanctuary and him , she sarcastically tells him , `` It 's amazing ! '' , and refuses his offer of fruit , stating that pomegranates are n't worth the trouble . Morgan , having swiftly gained Ezekiel 's confidence , is taken out with Ezekiel 's inner circle to perform a seemingly pointless task : herd a group of wild pigs into a barn far outside the Kingdom , where they feed on walkers . Ezekiel asks Morgan about his combat skills , as he sees Morgan is capable of using a staff , and asks him to train one of his men , Benjamin . After hesitating , Morgan agrees . Ezekiel brings Morgan and Benjamin to a secret meeting with the Saviors , who are given the walker - fed pigs , now slaughtered , as part of their tribute from the Kingdom . One of the Saviors , Jared , tells Richard the Saviors are letting the Kingdom off easy by taking only eight pigs , to which Richard replies : the Saviors are the ones being let off easy . Jared attacks Richard , and Ezekiel makes them break up the fight . The leader of the Saviors group tells Jared to stop only after Jared has hit Richard a few times . The Saviors leave and say they will want produce next time , or Richard will be the first to die . During the night , Carol is picking fruit as she prepares to leave town quietly , and Ezekiel catches her . He explains that he realized Carol 's innocence was just an act but wonders how Carol could survive , and wants to know where she originally came from . After a few moments , Ezekiel slowly drops his guard and reveals that he was a zookeeper and amateur actor . He tells her that he developed the `` King Ezekiel '' persona so that the people would have someone to follow and to emphasize that there is still good in the world . Carol still wishes to leave , so Ezekiel suggests that she live in the abandoned house she passed on the way to the Kingdom , so that she could `` go and not go '' . She agrees to this arrangement . Morgan takes Carol out to the house , tells her to take care of herself , and returns to the Kingdom . Later , she gets a visit from Ezekiel and Shiva . Ezekiel once again offers her a pomegranate causing Carol to smile . \n Ezekiel bides his time and waits for the opportune moment to strike back against `` this tyrant '' . The opportunity Ezekiel is waiting for finally comes when Paul brings Rick Grimes to meet him and passes on the information they have regarding the Saviors ' strength and the location of their main base of operations . \n At some point , Ezekiel meets and forms a friendship with Paul Monroe ( who calls himself `` Jesus '' in the television series ) , who invites his community to join a trading network that includes the Hilltop community Paul belongs to . Ezekiel later discovers the Saviors are threatening and harassing the other communities in the trade network in exchange for supplies and possibly sees how vicious their leader , Negan really is ( despite the truce offered by the Saviors ) . \n During the war Ezekiel starts a relationship with Michonne . Two years after the war against the Saviors ends , Ezekiel and Michonne break up , but Ezekiel is confident about starting their relationship again . However , he and 11 other people are decapitated by Alpha during the conflict with the Whisperers . \n Prior to the outbreak , Ezekiel was a zookeeper in D.C. as well as a stage actor . At some point he met Shiva , a tiger cub who was injured in her exhibit . Ezekiel cared for and befriended Shiva and formed a strong bond with her . When the walker outbreak began , Ezekiel returned to the zoo and freed Shiva with the two being together ever since . Ezekiel subsequently founded a community known as the Kingdom which grew to be a thriving community , lush with food and comfort . To better inspire his people , Ezekiel began referring to himself as King Ezekiel and took on the mannerisms of a feudal king ( going so far as to speak in Shakespearean tone and form ) . He also formed a court of advisers to help him manage the Kingdom which include seasoned survivor Richard , his personal attendant and bodyguard Jerry and Benjamin , a young survivor who was the son of a good friend of Ezekiel 's . \n In the mid-season premiere `` Rock in the Road '' , Ezekiel is shown to be friends with Hilltop scout Paul Rovia , aka `` Jesus '' . Jesus introduces Ezekiel to Rick Grimes , the leader of Alexandria , another community forced to serve the Saviors . Rick implores Ezekiel to join their fight against the Saviors as only together can they succeed . Ezekiel takes the night to ponder his decision , but ultimately decides against open conflict with the Saviors as he refuses to endanger his people 's lives . He does , however , allow Rick 's friend Daryl Dixon to stay in the Kingdom to hide from the Saviors . Ezekiel appears in episode `` New Best Friends '' when the Saviors arrive for their offering . When Jared continues to insult Richard , the two draw guns on each other and Morgan and Ben are forced to stop further violence . Ezekiel later chastises Benjamin for acting hasty as violence must be reserved as a last resort . In the episode `` Bury Me Here '' , Ezekiel , Morgan , Ben , Richard and several others find a roadblock en route to their meeting with the Saviors . They then find a grave reading bury me here with Ezekiel claiming that it is only luck that the world has not driven them all insane , though Ben credits Ezekiel with keeping them together . They arrive to find that their load is short , causing Jared to shoot Ben . They bring him to Carol 's , but despite their best efforts , Ben dies . When they meet the Saviors to settle their debt Morgan attacks and kills Richard , strangling him to death . He reveals Richard was behind yesterday 's events to start a war . Ezekiel shown to be enraged at Richard 's betrayal while shocked at Morgan 's brutality ( though he still attempts to bring him back ) . Carol later goes to Ezekiel and apologizes for his loss before stating that it is time to fight . Ezekiel agrees , but states that they must wait before helping Ben 's younger brother tend to the gardens . In the season finale `` First Day of the Rest of Your Life '' , Ezekiel leads Carol and a group of Kingdom fighters to Alexandria to accept Rick 's alliance . They encounter Morgan along the way and Ezekiel convinces him to march with them as opposed to alone . Ezekiel 's arrival proves timely as their group arrives just as Negan is about to execute Carl . Ezekiel and Shiva charge into battle , killing numerous Saviors and help drive off the Saviors . The episode ends with Ezekiel standing beside Rick and Maggie Greene as the Kingdom , Hilltop and Alexandria pledge their aid to each other .",

    "context": "Rabbit is a character in the fictional world of the book series and cartoons Winnie - the - Pooh . He is a friend of Winnie - the - Pooh , regards himself as practical and tends to take the lead , though not always with the results that he intends . \n Rabbit also has good relationships with the minor animals in the forest , known as `` Rabbit 's Friends - and - Relations '' . Several are mentioned by name , including beetles called Small , Alexander Beetle and Henry Rush , and three unspecified creatures called Smallest - of - All , Late , and Early . According to the illustrations of the book , his Friends - and - Relations include other rabbits , a squirrel , a hedgehog , mice , and insects . At one point , Rabbit estimates that he would need `` seventeen pockets '' if he were going to carry all his family about with him . Whether that number refers just to his relatives or to the friends - and - relations as a group is unknown , if it had any basis at all . \n While the literacy ( or lack thereof ) of Pooh , Owl , and Eeyore becomes a plot point in The House at Pooh Corner , Rabbit 's ease with reading and writing is taken for granted . \n In the Disney adaptations , Rabbit and Tigger are usually foils for each other . In the original featurettes , Rabbit outright dislikes Tigger . By The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh , however , they have become close friends , though very dysfunctional ones , who regularly work together . Tigger 's antics continue to annoy Rabbit and make trouble for him , while Rabbit 's harsh attitude and attempts to teach Tigger a lesson still come off as unkind . Nevertheless , Tigger is usually the first one to help Rabbit when he needs it and Rabbit can not deny their closeness . \n The first appearance of Rabbit is in chapter II in the Winnie - the - Pooh book by A.A. Milne . He also appears in chapters VII , VIII , IX and X of that book , as well as in chapters III , V , VI , VII , VIII , IX , and X in The House at Pooh Corner . \n In Return to the Hundred Acre Wood , a sequel not written by A.A. Milne but by David Benedictus , Rabbit tries to organize things further . He tries to have a census in the forest , but it does not work out very well . Rabbit also attempts to teach a Household Management class and is the one who discovers Lottie the otter . His grandfather , Grandad Buck , appears in the book . \n Junius Matthews was the voice of Rabbit in the first three Disney films . After his death , Ray Erlenborn briefly voiced him in Winnie the Pooh Discovers the Seasons . Will Ryan took over the role for Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore and performed both Rabbit and Tigger in Welcome to Pooh Corner . \n Rabbit appears in most Disney Winnie the Pooh cartoons , but he is green instead of brown . An added element is his keeping of a garden , of which he is strongly protective , becoming angered when any creature seeks to damage it . Although he is not described as having a garden in either of the A.A. Milne books , he has one in David Benedictus 's Return to the Hundred Acre Wood . \n Ken Sansom replaced Ryan beginning with The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and is to date Rabbit 's longest - running portrayer , having continued the voice up to and including My Friends Tigger and Pooh . Tom Kenny most recently provided the voice for the 2011 film , Winnie the Pooh . Peter Capaldi will voice Rabbit in Christopher Robin , the live - action adaptation of Winnie the Pooh franchise . \n The Disney adaptations also develop his personality further , expanding the original organized character into a control freak with a short temper , although his care for his friends remains . The film character 's willingness to do things by the book appeared in Pooh 's Grand Adventure : The Search for Christopher Robin , in which he consistently follows written instructions for fear of being unable to think well for himself , although he later produces a competent plan . Despite occasional malevolent behavior , he always learns from his wrongdoing ; while a leading character in the film Springtime with Roo , he abandons his selfishness after considering the possibility that it will drive all of the other characters away from the forest . \n Rabbit lives in a house in the north - central part of the Hundred Acre Wood , between the sandy pit where Roo plays and the area where the animals he calls his `` Friends - and - Relations '' live . Rabbit likes to take charge and come up with elaborate plans , such as the one to scare Kanga by hiding Roo , and the one to `` unbounce '' Tigger . He is also an organizer , as in the case of the Search for Small . As detailed as his plans are , they often miss certain key points and go wrong . \n While most of the cast in the books are based on stuffed animals owned by Christopher Robin Milne , Ernest H. Shepard 's illustrations of Rabbit look more like a living animal . Rabbit resembles a typical rabbit , except that he walks on two legs and uses his front paws as hands . The top of his head reaches about to Pooh 's nose . \n His character is consistent in most of the Disney adaptations , although in Welcome to Pooh Corner , he is a talented magician and in The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh , he is pale green instead of yellow . At one point in the latter series , Rabbit adopts a bluebird named Kessie . As of 2004 , Rabbit now appears at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista , FL and Disneyland in Anaheim , CA for meet and greets . \n Rabbit tends to include Pooh and Piglet in his plans , and he goes to Owl when there is `` thinking to be done '' . He likes to be put in charge of things and is sometimes bossy , and he sees his relationship to Christopher Robin as being the one that Christopher depends on . While loyal to the friends he knows , Rabbit shows a certain reluctance to welcome newcomers , as evidenced by his initial negative reaction to the arrival of Kanga and Roo in the first book , and to Tigger in the second book . Nonetheless , he warms up to all of them in time .",

    "context": "They are found in west Africa from Senegal , Mali , Guinea - Bissau , Guinea , Sierra Leone , Liberia , Ivory Coast , Ghana , Benin , and Nigeria through Cameroon , Chad , and the Central African Republic to Sudan and Uganda . No type locality was given in the original description . \n The ball python bears a strong physical resemblance to the Burmese python , whose adaptive abilities have caused it to become classified as an invasive species in places such as the Florida Everglades . The ball python , however , has not been known to reproduce in the wild outside of its native range and no reproducing wild populations are known in Florida . \n Females are oviparous , with 3 to 11 rather large , leathery eggs being laid ( four to six are most common ) . These are incubated by the female under the ground ( via a shivering motion ) , and hatch after 55 to 60 days . Sexual maturity is reached at 11 -- 18 months for males , and 20 -- 36 months for females . Age is only one factor in determining sexual maturity and ability to breed ; weight is the second factor . Males breed at 600 g or more , but in captivity are often not bred until they are 800 g ( 1.7 lb ) , although in captivity , some males have been known to begin breeding at 300 -- 400 g . Females breed in the wild at weights as low as 800 g though 1200 g or more in weight is most common ; in captivity , breeders generally wait until they are no less than 1500 g ( 3.3 lb ) . Parental care of the eggs ends once they hatch , and the female leaves the offspring to fend for themselves . \n This species is particularly revered in the traditional religion of the Igbo people of southeastern Nigeria . It is considered symbolic of the earth , being an animal that travels so close to the ground . Even among many Christian Igbos , these pythons are treated with great care whenever they happen to wander into a village or onto someone 's property ; they are allowed to roam freely or are very gently picked up and placed out in a forest or field away from any homes . If one is accidentally killed , many communities in Igboland still build a coffin for the snake 's remains and give it a short funeral . \n In the wild , their diet consists mostly of small mammals , such as African soft - furred rats , shrews , and striped mice and birds . Younger pythons , under 70 cm total length , and males prey almost exclusively on small birds ( nestlings and immature young ) whilst pythons greater than 70 cm total length , and females prey almost exclusively on small mammals . \n This terrestrial species is known for its defense strategy that involves coiling into a tight ball when threatened , with its head and neck tucked away in the middle . In this state , it can literally be rolled around . Favored retreats include mammal burrows and other underground hiding places , where they also aestivate . In captivity , they are considered good pets , with their relatively small size and placid nature making them easy to handle . \n The color pattern is typically black or dark brown with light brown or gold sides and dorsal blotches . The belly is a white or cream that may include scattered black markings . However , those in the pet industries have , through selective breeding , developed many morphs ( genetic mutations ) with altered colors and patterns . \n Maximum adult length of this species is 182 cm ( 6.0 ft ) . Females tend to be slightly bigger than males , maturing around 122 -- 137 cm ( 4.0 -- 4.5 ft ) . Males typically grow to around 90 -- 107 cm ( 3.0 -- 3.5 ft ) . Their build is stocky , while the head is relatively small . The scales are smooth and both sexes have anal spurs on either side of the vent . Although males tend to have larger spurs , this is not definitive , and sex is best determined by manual eversion of the male hemipenes or inserting a probe into the cloaca to check the presence of an inverted hemipenis ( if male ) . When probing to determine sex , males typically measure eight to 10 subcaudal scales , and females typically measure two to four subcaudal scales . \n Wild - caught specimens have greater difficulty adapting to a captive environment , which can result in refusal to feed , and they generally carry internal or external parasites . Specimens have survived for over 40 years in captivity , with the oldest recorded ball python being kept in captivity 47 years and 6 months until its death in 1992 at the Philadelphia Zoo . \n The ball python ( Python regius ) , also known as the royal python , is a python species found in sub-Saharan Africa . Like all other pythons , it is a nonvenomous constrictor . This is the smallest of the African pythons and is popular in the pet trade , largely due to its small size and typically docile temperament . No subspecies are currently recognized . The name `` ball python '' refers to the animal 's tendency to curl into a ball when stressed or frightened . The name `` royal python '' ( from the Latin regius ) comes from the fact that rulers in Africa would wear the python as jewelry . \n Hundreds of different color patterns are available in captive snakes . Some of the most common are Spider , Pastel , Albino , Mojave , and Lesser . Breeders are continuously creating new designer morphs , and over 5,300 different morphs currently exist . \n Ball pythons prefer grasslands , savannas , and sparsely wooded areas . but have been shown to adapt to all types of environments . Males tend to display more semi-arboreal behaviours , whilst females tend towards terrestrial behaviours .",

    "context": "Fireless steam locomotives were steam locomotives that operated from a supply of steam stored on board in a large tank resembling a conventional locomotive 's boiler . This tank was filled by process steam , as is available in many sorts of large factory , such as paper mills . The locomotive 's propulsion used pistons and connecting rods , as for a typical steam locomotive . These locomotives were mostly used in places where there was a risk of fire from a boiler 's firebox , but were also used in factories that simply had a plentiful supply of steam to spare . \n Steam tables contain thermodynamic data for water / steam and are often used by engineers and scientists in design and operation of equipment where thermodynamic cycles involving steam are used . Additionally , thermodynamic phase diagrams for water / steam , such as a temperature - entropy diagram or a Mollier diagram shown in this article , may be useful . Steam charts are also used for analysing thermodynamic cycles . \n In agriculture , steam is used for soil sterilization to avoid the use of harmful chemical agents and increase soil health . \n In electric generation , steam is typically condensed at the end of its expansion cycle , and returned to the boiler for re-use . However , in cogeneration , steam is piped into buildings through a district heating system to provide heat energy after its use in the electric generation cycle . The world 's biggest steam generation system is the New York City steam system , which pumps steam into 100,000 buildings in Manhattan from seven cogeneration plants . \n Steam is used in the process of wood bending , killing insects and increasing plasticity . \n Steam engines and steam turbines use the expansion of steam to drive a piston or turbine to perform mechanical work . The ability to return condensed steam as water - liquid to the boiler at high pressure with relatively little expenditure of pumping power is important . Condensation of steam to water often occurs at the low - pressure end of a steam turbine , since this maximizes the energy efficiency , but such wet - steam conditions must be limited to avoid excessive turbine blade erosion . Engineers use an idealised thermodynamic cycle , the Rankine cycle , to model the behavior of steam engines . Steam turbines are often used in the production of electricity . \n Steam , especially dry ( highly superheated ) steam , may be used for antimicrobial cleaning even to the levels of sterilization . Steam is a non-toxic antimicrobial agent . \n Owing to its low molecular mass , steam is an effective lifting gas , providing approximately 60 % as much lift as helium and twice as much as hot air . It is not flammable , unlike hydrogen , and is cheap and abundant , unlike helium . The required heat , however , leads to condensation problems and requires an insulated envelope . These factors have limited its use thus far to mostly demonstration projects . \n The enthalpy of vaporization is the energy required to turn water into the gaseous form when it increases in volume by 1,700 times at standard temperature and pressure ; this change in volume can be converted into mechanical work by steam engines such as reciprocating piston type engines and steam turbines , which are a sub-group of steam engines . Piston type steam engines played a central role to the Industrial Revolution and modern steam turbines are used to generate more than 80 % of the world 's electricity . If liquid water comes in contact with a very hot surface or depressurizes quickly below its vapor pressure , it can create a steam explosion . \n Wikiversity has steam tables with figures and Matlab code \n Steam 's capacity to transfer heat is also used in the home : for cooking vegetables , steam cleaning of fabric , carpets and flooring , and for heating buildings . In each case , water is heated in a boiler , and the steam carries the energy to a target object . Steam is also used in ironing clothes to add enough humidity with the heat to take wrinkles out and put intentional creases into the clothing . \n Steam is traditionally created by heating a boiler via burning coal and other fuels , but it is also possible to create steam with solar energy . Water vapor that includes water droplets is described as wet steam . As wet steam is heated further , the droplets evaporate , and at a high enough temperature ( which depends on the pressure ) all of the water evaporates and the system is in vapor -- liquid equilibrium . \n Superheated steam is steam at a temperature higher than its boiling point for the pressure , which only occurs where all liquid water has evaporated or has been removed from the system . \n Steam is water in the gas phase , which is formed when water boils . Steam is invisible ; however , `` steam '' often refers to wet steam , the visible mist or aerosol of water droplets formed as this water vapour condenses . At lower pressures , such as in the upper atmosphere or at the top of high mountains , water boils at a lower temperature than the nominal 100 ° C ( 212 ° F ) at standard pressure . If heated further it becomes superheated steam . \n In other industrial applications steam is used for energy storage , which is introduced and extracted by heat transfer , usually through pipes . Steam is a capacious reservoir for thermal energy because of water 's high heat of vaporization . \n An autoclave , which uses steam under pressure , is used in microbiology laboratories and similar environments for sterilization . \n Steam is used to accentuate drying especially in prefabricates . Care should be taken since concrete produces heat during hydration and additional heat from the steam could be detrimental to hardening reaction processes of the concrete . \n Used in cleaning of fibers and other materials , sometimes in preparation for painting . Steam is also useful in melting hardened grease and oil residues , so it is useful in cleaning kitchen floors and equipment and internal combustion engines and parts . Among the advantages of using steam versus a hot water spray are the facts that steam can operate at higher temperatures and it uses substantially less water per minute . \n Steam is used in piping for utility lines . It is also used in jacketing and tracing of piping to maintain the uniform temperature in pipelines and vessels . \n About 90 % of all electricity is generated using steam as the working fluid , nearly all by steam turbines .",

    "answers": "",
    "context": "There are endless ways to exercise management by objectives . One must simply find specific goals to aim for in an organization or business . Many noteworthy companies have used MBO . The management at the computer company Hewlett - Packard ( HP ) , has said that it considers the policy a huge component of its success . Many other corporations praise the effectiveness of MBO , including Xerox , DuPont , Intel , and countless others . Companies that use MBO often report greater sales rates and productiveness within the organization . Objectives can be set in all domains of activities , such as production , marketing , services , sales , R&D , human resources , finance , and information systems . Some objectives are collective , and some can be goals for each individual worker . Both make the task at hand seem attainable and enable the workers to visualize what needs to be done and how . \n Proponents argue that benefits of MBO include : \n In the MBO paradigm , managers determine the mission and the strategic goals of the enterprise . The goals set by top - level managers are based on an analysis of what can and should be accomplished by the organization within a specific period of time . The functions of these managers can be centralised by appointing a project manager who can monitor and control activities of the various departments . If this can not be done or is not desirable , each manager 's contributions to the organizational goal should be clearly spelled out . \n Objectives need quantifying and monitoring . Reliable management information systems are needed to establish relevant objectives and monitor their `` reach ratio '' in an objective way . Pay incentives ( bonuses ) are often linked to results in reaching the objectives . \n After the term and idea were brought up , Drucker 's student , George Odiorne , continued to develop the idea in his book Management Decisions by Objectives , published in the mid-1960s . MBO was popularized by companies like Hewlett - Packard , who claimed it led to their success . \n When this approach is not properly set , agreed and managed by organizations , self - centered employees might be prone to distort results , falsely representing achievement of targets that were set in a short - term , narrow fashion . In this case , managing by objectives would be counterproductive . \n While the practice is used today , it may go by different names -- the letters `` MBO '' have lost their formality , and future planning is a more standard practice . \n MBO has its detractors and attention notably among them W. Edwards Deming , who argued that a lack of understanding of systems commonly results in the misapplication of objectives . Additionally , Deming stated that setting production targets will encourage workers to meet those targets through whatever means necessary , which usually results in poor quality . \n It 's modern way of setting objectives . Management by objectives ( MBO ) , also known as management by results ( MBR ) , was first popularized by Peter Drucker in his 1954 book The Practice of Management . Management by objectives is the process of defining specific objectives within an organization that management can convey to organization members , then deciding on how to achieve each objective in sequence . This process allows managers to take work that needs to be done one step at a time to allow for a calm , yet productive work environment . This process also helps organization members to see their accomplishments as they achieve each objective , which reinforces a positive work environment and a sense of achievement . An important part of MBO is the measurement and comparison of an employee 's actual performance with the standards set . Ideally , when employees themselves have been involved with the goal - setting and choosing the course of action to be followed by them , they are more likely to fulfill their responsibilities . According to George S. Odiorne , the system of management by objectives can be described as a process whereby the superior and subordinate jointly identify common goals , define each individual 's major areas of responsibility in terms of the results expected of him or her , and use these measures as guides for operating the unit and assessing the contribution of each of its members . \n That context includes everything from the availability and quality of resources , to relative buy - in by leadership and stake - holders . As an example of the influence of management buy - in as a contextual influencer , in a 1991 comprehensive review of thirty years of research on the impact of Management by Objectives , Robert Rodgers and John Hunter concluded that companies whose CEOs demonstrated high commitment to MBO showed , on average , a 56 % gain in productivity . Companies with CEOs who showed low commitment only saw a 6 % gain in productivity . \n Point 7 of Deming 's key principles encourages managers to abandon objectives in favour of leadership because he felt that a leader with an understanding of systems was more likely to guide workers to an appropriate solution than the incentive of an objective . Deming also pointed out that Drucker warned managers that a systemic view was required and felt that Drucker 's warning went largely unheeded by the practitioners of MBO . \n The mnemonic S.M.A.R.T. is associated with the process of setting objectives in this paradigm . `` SMART '' objectives are : \n Management by objectives at its core is the process of employers / supervisors attempting to manage their subordinates by introducing a set of specific goals that both the employee and the company strive to achieve in the near future , and working to meet those goals accordingly . \n There are several limitations to the assumptive base underlying the impact of managing by objectives , including : \n The aphorism `` what gets measured gets done '' , is aligned with the MBO philosophy . \n The principle of MBO is for employees to have a clear understanding of their roles and the responsibilities expected of them , so they can understand how their activities relate to the achievement of the organization 's goals . MBO also places importance on fulfilling the personal goals of each employee . \n Management by Objectives is still practiced today , with a focus on planning and development aiding various organizations . The most recent research focuses on specific industries , specifying the practice of MBO for each . In addition , following criticism of the original MBO approach , a new formula was introduced in 2016 , aiming at revitalizing it , that is the OPTIMAL MBO , which stands for its components , namely : ( O ) Objectives , Outside - in ; ( P ) Profitability ( budget ) related goals ; ( T ) Target Setting ; ( I ) Incentives & Influence ; ( M ) Measurement ; ( A ) Agreement , Accountability , Appraisal , Appreciation ; and ( L ) Leadership Support . \n Peter Drucker first used the term `` management by objectives '' in his 1954 book The Practice of Management . While the basic ideas of MBO were not original to Drucker , they pulled from other management practices to create a complete `` system '' . The idea draws on the many ideas presented in Mary Parker Follett 's 1926 essay , `` The Giving of Orders '' .",

    "context": "The eagle , shoulder boards , and dress blue sleeve stripes of a U.S. Coast Guard captain \n In the United States Navy , captain ( abbreviated CAPT ) is a senior officer rank , with the pay grade of O - 6 . It ranks above commander and below rear admiral ( lower half ) . It is equivalent to the rank of colonel in the other uniformed services . Promotion to captain is governed by Department of Defense policies derived from the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act ( DOPMA ) of 1980 or its companion Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act ( ROPMA ) . DOPMA / ROPMA guidelines suggest that no more than 50 % of eligible commanders should be promoted to captain after serving a minimum of three years at their present rank and after attaining 21 -- 23 years of cumulative commissioned service , although this percentage may be appreciably less contingent on force structure and the needs of the service . With very few exceptions , such as Naval Aviator Astronaut and Naval Flight Officer Astronaut , unrestricted line officer captains in the Navy will have successfully completed at least one commanding officer assignment at the commander ( O - 5 ) level , typically a destroyer or frigate for surface warfare officers , a nuclear - powered attack submarine or ballistic missile submarine for submarine warfare officers , a SEAL team for special warfare officers , or an aviation squadron for Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers , before being selected for promotion to captain . \n The eagle , shoulder boards , and sleeve stripes ( dress blues + female dress whites ) of a USPHS captain \n As opposed to unrestricted line captains , restricted line and staff corps captains will command facilities and organizations appropriate to their designators , such as intelligence centers commanded by intelligence officers ; naval aviation depots / fleet readiness centers commanded by aeronautical engineering duty officers ; naval hospitals commanded by Medical Corps ( MC ) , Dental Corps ( DC ) , Medical Service Corps ( MSC ) , or Nurse Corps ( NC ) officers ; supply centers by Supply Corps ( SC ) officers ; Construction Battalions or civil engineering centers by Civil Engineer Corps ( CEC ) officers ; or region legal service offices or defense service offices commanded by Judge Advocate General 's Corps ( JAGC ) officers . \n Although it exists largely as a maritime training organization , the United States Maritime Service also uses the rank of captain . Even though the Maritime Service is an auxiliary service , the grade is appointed by the President via the Secretary of Transportation , making it a federally recognized rank with corresponding paygrade of O - 6 . \n USN , USCG , USPHSCC , and NOAACOC collar , cover ( hat ) , or shoulder rank insignia ( on select uniforms ) \n In the Naval Special Warfare `` Sea Air Land '' ( SEAL ) community , captains with sea commands are typically commodores in command of Naval Special Warfare Groups ( NAVSPECWARGRU ) . \n In contrast , commanders of aircraft carrier strike groups ( CSG ) and expeditionary strike groups ( ESG ) are normally rear admirals , while subordinate destroyer squadron commodores , amphibious squadron commodores , carrier air wing commanders and the individual ship commanding officers within the strike group are of captain rank or lower . In addition , in the expeditionary strike group , the Marine Expeditionary Unit ( MEU ) commanding officer will always be a Marine Corps colonel . Adding to the confusion , all commanding officers of commissioned U.S. Navy warships and submarines ( e.g. , USS or `` United States Ship '' ) are called `` captain '' regardless of actual rank . \n The United States Coast Guard also uses the same naval rank system for its commissioned officers as the U.S. Navy , with a Coast Guard captain ranking above a commander and below rear admiral ( lower half ) . The sleeve and shoulder board insignia are similar to the Navy insignia , with a lighter shade of blue with a gold USCG shield above the stripes . Coast Guard captains follow career paths very similar to their Navy counterparts , with marine safety , security , and boat forces officers serving as Captain of the Port in command of Coast Guard Sectors , seagoing officers typically commanding large maritime security cutters or high endurance cutters and aviators commanding coast guard air stations . Coast Guard captains will also command all types of major Coast Guard shore installations and activities , as well as serve as chiefs of staff / executive assistants , senior operations officers , and other senior staff officers for Coast Guard flag officers . The Coast Guard has no staff corps officers . \n Navy captains with sea commands in the surface warfare officer community generally command ships of cruiser size or larger . The more senior the officer , the larger the ship . Others may hold command as commodores of destroyer squadrons ( DESRON ) consisting of multiple destroyers and frigates . Surface Warfare Officers may also command large deck amphibious warfare ships or combat support ships and also serve as commodores of amphibious squadrons ( PHIBRON ) or other type of surface ship squadrons . \n In the United States Public Health Service ( USPHS ) , and in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps , captains are senior non-combatant officers that serve as directors or ranking supervisors in their respective uniformed service corps . Seagoing NOAA captains command certain National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) ships , while NOAA aviators command NOAA flight operations activities . USPHS rapid deployment force teams , containing 105 USPHS physicians , nurses , and other medical professionals , are commanded exclusively by captains . \n Navy captains who are line officers may also fill important senior command and staff positions ashore as Chiefs of Staff / Executive Assistants or senior operations officers to flag officers , or they may hold shore command assignments such as commanding officers of naval bases , naval stations , naval air stations , naval air facilities , naval support activities , logistics groups , specialized centers or schools , or commanders of test wings or training air wings . They may also occupy senior leadership positions on fleet staffs , naval component commands staffs , the staffs of the joint Unified Combatant Commands , the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations ( OPNAV ) , or the Joint Staff . \n In Naval Aviation , captains with sea commands are Naval Aviators or Naval Flight Officers who are commanding officers of aircraft carriers , commanding officers of large - deck air - capable amphibious assault ships , commanders of carrier air wings ( CAG ) , or commodores of functional or `` type '' air wings or air groups . A smaller cohort outside of sea and shore commands may also serve as astronauts on loan to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) . \n In the United States Navy , United States Coast Guard , United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps ( USPHS ) , and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps ( NOAA Corps ) , captain is the senior-most commissioned officer rank below that of flag officer ( i.e. , admirals ) . The equivalent rank is colonel in the United States Army , Air Force , and Marine Corps . The predecessors of the NOAA Corps -- the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps ( 1917 -- 1965 ) and the Environmental Science Services Administration Corps ( ESSA Corps ) ( 1965 -- 1970 ) -- also used the rank . \n The eagle , shoulder boards , and sleeve stripes ( dress blues + female dress whites ) of a NOAA captain \n Like the U.S. Navy , all commanding officers of commissioned cutters ( e.g. , USCGC or `` United States Coast Guard Cutter '' ) are addressed as `` captain '' regardless of their actual rank . \n In the submarine community , a captain typically commanded a nuclear - powered ballistic missile submarine ( SSBN ) until the early 21st century when the requisite rank for the position was downgraded to that of a commander . Today , like their surface warfare counterparts , captains in the submarine community may serve as commodores of submarine squadrons ( SUBRON ) , commanding a group of SSBNs or attack submarines ( SSN ) . \n Reflecting its nautical heritage , the term `` captain '' also sometimes is used as a military title by more junior officers who are serving as the commanding officer ( CO ) of a commissioned vessel of the Navy , Coast Guard , or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ship of patrol boat size or greater , while officers below O - 6 commanding aviation squadrons ( typically O - 5 commanders ) will usually use the less formal title of `` skipper .

Morgan & Co . \n Paul Julius Reuter established the Reuters news agency at No. 1 , Royal Exchange Buildings ( opposite and to the east of the Royal Exchange ) in 1851 . It later moved to Fleet Street . \n Richard Clough initially suggested building the exchange in 1562 , and oversaw the exporting of some of the materials from Antwerp : stone , slate , wainscot and glass , for which he paid thousands of pounds himself . The Royal Exchange was officially opened on 23 January 1571 by Queen Elizabeth I who awarded the building its royal title and a licence to sell alcohol . Only the exchange of goods took place until the 17th century . Stockbrokers were not allowed into the Royal Exchange because of their rude manners , hence they had to operate from other establishments in the vicinity , such as Jonathan 's Coffee - House . Gresham 's original building was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 . A second complex was built on the site , designed by Edward Jarman and opened in 1669 , but that also burned down , on 10 January 1838 . It had been used by the Lloyd 's insurance market , which was forced to move temporarily to South Sea House following the 1838 fire . \n The third Royal Exchange building , which still stands today , was designed by William Tite and adheres to the original layout -- consisting of a four - sided structure surrounding a central courtyard where merchants and tradesmen could do business . The internal works , designed by Edward I'Anson in 1837 , made use of concrete -- an early example of this modern construction method . It features pediment sculptures by Richard Westmacott ( the younger ) , and ornamental cast ironwork by Henry Grissell 's Regent 's Canal Ironworks . It was opened by Queen Victoria on 28 October 1844 though trading did not commence until 1 January 1845 . \n Traditionally , the steps of the Royal Exchange is the place where certain royal proclamations ( such as the dissolution of parliament ) are read out by either a herald or a crier . Following the death or abdication of a monarch and the confirmation of the next monarch 's accession to the throne by the Accession Council , the Royal Exchange Building is one of the locations where a herald proclaims the new monarch 's reign to the public . \n From 1892 , twenty - four scenes from London 's history were painted on the first - floor walls by artists including Sir Frederick Leighton , Sir Frank Brangwyn and Stanhope Forbes . The murals run as a sequence . \n With the outbreak of the Second World War , trading at the Royal Exchange virtually ended . At the war 's end , the building had survived the Blitz , albeit with some near misses . \n Two statues stand in niches in the central courtyard . Charles II a copy of 1792 by John Spiller after Grinling Gibbons ' statue in the centre of the C17 courtyard , and Queen Elizabeth I by M.L. Watson , 1844 . The Charles II statue survived the fire of 1838 that destroyed the previous Exchange . The Elizabeth I statue was commissioned as she was the monarch who had conferred the status `` Royal '' on the Exchange . \n In 1982 the Royal Exchange was in disrepair -- particularly the glass roof was in danger of collapse . The newly formed London International Financial Futures Exchange ( LIFFE ) was the main tenant , using the courtyard for the trading floor , all done without touching the framework of the original building . Other tenants moved in later and as a result of LIFFE 's presence , not only did the City experience growth in trading and greater efficiency in pricing , but also a boost to the area around the Royal Exchange that was sleepy at best . \n In June 1844 , just before the reopening of the Royal Exchange , a statue of Arthur Wellesley , 1st Duke of Wellington , was unveiled outside the building . The bronze used to cast it was sourced from enemy cannons captured during Wellington 's continental campaigns . \n The Royal Exchange in London was founded in the 16th century by the merchant Thomas Gresham on the suggestion of his factor Richard Clough to act as a centre of commerce for the City of London . The site was provided by the City of London Corporation and the Worshipful Company of Mercers , who still jointly own the freehold . It is trapezoidal in shape and is flanked by Cornhill and Threadneedle Street , which converge at Bank junction in the heart of the City . The building 's original design was inspired by a bourse Gresham had seen in Antwerp and was Britain 's first specialist commercial building . \n In 2013 the Royal Exchange was sold by the Anglo Irish Private Bank to Oxford Properties , a Canadian property company . It had been announced that the site would be sold with a 104 - year lease . Oxford Properties Group , a division of the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System , bought the retail centre for a reported £ 86.5 million . \n It has twice been destroyed by fire and subsequently rebuilt . The present building was designed by William Tite in the 1840s . The site was notably occupied by the Lloyd 's insurance market for nearly 150 years . Today the Royal Exchange contains a Courtyard Grand Cafe , Threadneedle Cocktail Bar , Sauterelle Restaurant , luxury shops , and offices ( http://www.royalexchange-grandcafe.co.uk/ ) . \n The western end of the building consists of a portico of eight Corinthian columns topped by a pediment containing a tympanum with a sculptured frieze by Richard Westmacott ( the younger ) . The central figure represents Commerce , above an inscription from the Bible : `` The Earth is the Lord 's , and the fulness thereof '' . The Latin inscription states that the Exchange was founded in the thirteenth year of Queen Elizabeth , and restored in the eighth of Queen Victoria . \n In 2001 the Royal Exchange was once again extensively remodelled , this time by architects Aukett Fitzroy Robinson . Reconstruction of the courtyard created new boutiques and restaurants to add to the existing retailers on the perimeter . The Royal Exchange is now a retail centre with shops , cafes and restaurants . The restaurants include Royal Exchange Grand Cafe , Threadneedle Cockatil Bar and Sauterelle Restaurant ( http://www.royalexchange-grandcafe.co.uk/ ) . Shops include Boodles , Hermès , Georg Jensen and Tiffany & Co . In 2003 the Grand Café and Bar was launched and completed the building .",

    "context": "Annie Oakley is an American Western television series that fictionalized the life of the famous sharpshooter Annie Oakley . Featuring actress Gail Davis in the title role , the weekly program ran from January 1954 to February 1957 in syndication . A total of 81 black - and - white episodes were produced , with each installment running 25 minutes in length . ABC aired daytime reruns of the series on Saturdays and Sundays from 1959 to 1960 and then again from 1964 to 1965 . \n Additional episodes were being considered , but Jimmy Hawkins had a growth spurt and outgrew the part of Annie 's little brother . \n On March 31 , 2009 , Mill Creek Entertainment released Gun Justice Featuring The Lone Ranger , with other television Westerns such as Annie Oakley . \n Annie always wore the same fringed cowgirl outfit , of which 15 or more copies were made throughout the show 's production . Her hairstyle was braided pigtails . \n In the series , Annie Oakley rode a horse named Target ; Tagg 's horse was Pixie ; and Lofty 's mount was named Forest . Annie and Tagg lived in the town of Diablo , Arizona , with their uncle , Sheriff Luke MacTavish , who was frequently away whenever trouble started . It would then be up to straight - shooting Annie and her `` silent suitor '' Lofty Craig to rescue law - abiding neighbors and arrest outlaws . Often Tagg would be told to stay in town and out of the way ; but through either disobedience , the need to relay important new information , or being captured by outlaws , he would usually end up in the middle of each episode 's adventure . \n Many of these issues were later reprinted in black and white by L. Miller and World Distributors Ltd . \n Annie Oakley was among Gene Autry 's Flying A Productions . \n Approximately two dozen episodes lapsed into the public domain and are currently available on DVD in North America ( including several releases issued through Davis 's estate ) and elsewhere , although a full - series release has yet to happen . \n On July 11 , 2014 , it was announced that VCI Entertainment will release the complete series on DVD in Region 1 for the first time on October 21 , 2014 . \n At least three `` Authorized TV Adventures '' were published by Whitman Publishing Company . \n The show starred Gail Davis as Annie Oakley , with Brad Johnson in the role of Deputy Sheriff Lofty Craig and Jimmy Hawkins as Annie 's little brother , Tagg Oakley . Hawkins would ultimately play Tagg in 80 of the series ' 81 episodes . In the pilot episode , `` Bull 's Eye '' , Tagg was performed by Billy Gray , who is better known for his role as James `` Bud '' Anderson , Jr. , on the television version of Father Knows Best . Following his portrayal of Tagg in the Annie Oakley pilot , Gray opted to join the cast of Father Knows Best , which premiered on television in October 1954 , nine months after the initial broadcast of Annie Oakley . \n A number of American comics were based on the TV series : \n Dick Tufeld appeared fifteen times in assorted roles during the course of the series ; Harry Lauter , twelve times ; Stanley Andrews and Gregg Barton , eleven times each ; Myron Healey , ten times ; Roy Barcroft , eight times ; William Fawcett , prior to his role as Pete Wilkey in Fury , seven times ; William Tannen , six times , and Don C. Harvey , five times .",

    "context": "Software DVD players are programs that allow users to view DVD videos on a computer with a DVD - ROM drive . Some examples are the VLC media player , 5KPlayer and MPlayer ( all free software ) , as well as WinDVD , TotalMedia Theatre , PowerDVD , Fluendo DVD Player and DVD Player . \n Some DVD players include a USB video recorder . As well as such , there are also have DVD players with a USB port to be able to play digital media types as well as MP4 , MP3 , etc . \n Additionally , most DVD players allow users to play audio CDs ( CD - DA , MP3 , etc . ) and Video CDs ( VCD ) . A few include a home cinema decoder ( i.e. Dolby Digital , Digital Theater Systems ( DTS ) ) . Some newer devices also play videos in the MPEG - 4 ASP video compression format ( such as DivX ) popular in the Internet . \n Players slowly trickled into other regions around the world . Prices for the first players in 1997 were $1000 and up . By the end of 2000 , players were available for under $100 at discount retailers . In 2003 players became available for under $50 . Six years after the initial launch , close to one thousand models of DVD players were available from over a hundred consumer electronics manufacturers . \n Most hardware DVD players have to be connected to a television ; there are portable devices which have an attached LCD screen and stereo speakers . Portable DVD players are often used for long road trips and travel . They often have a plug for the 12 volt power jack in cars . Some models have two screens , so that two people in the back seat can both watch the movie . Other portable DVD players have a single screen that opens up like a laptop computer screen . \n As of 2002 the largest producer of DVD players is China ; in 2002 they produced 30 million players , more than 70 % of the world output . These producers have to pay US $15 -- $20 per player in license fees , to the patent holders of the DVD technology ( Sony , Philips , Toshiba and Time Warner ) as well as for MPEG - 2 licenses . To avoid these fees , China has developed the Enhanced Versatile Disc standard as an intended successor of DVD ; as of 2004 , EVD players were only being sold in China . \n Among others , there are variants & huge kinds of software DVD players as well as multimedia player software which has DVD video playback capability , whether its proprietary - type ( as commercial software ) , freeware , shareware or just a free software are available in the market . \n Wireless connections ( bluetooth and / or wifi ) are useful to manage ( play / record ) wirelessly content from or to other devices ( i.e. cell phones ) . \n Due to multiple audio ( and video ) output devices , there are many outputs on a DVD player , such as an RCA jack , component outputs , and an HDMI output . Consumers may become confused with how to connect a player to a TV or amplifier . Most systems include an optional digital audio connector for this task , which is then paired with a similar input on the amplifier . The physical connection is typically RCA connectors or TOSLINK , which transmits a S / PDIF stream carrying either uncompressed digital audio ( PCM ) or the original compressed audio data ( Dolby Digital , DTS , MPEG audio ) to be decoded by the audio equipment . \n There are successors to the DVD player : the HD DVD player and the Blu - ray Disc player , utilizing two incompatible technologies that reproduce higher quality video images than standard DVD . On February 19 , 2008 , Toshiba , creator of the former technology announced it would cease production on all HD DVD products leaving Blu - ray as the high definition successor to DVD players . Also , upscaling and up - converting DVD units are available that connect to televisions via a high definition interface and increase the overall picture quality . \n HDMI is a new digital connection for carrying high - definition video , similar to DVI . Along with video , HDMI also supports up to eight - channel digital audio . DVD players with connectors for high - definition video can upconvert the source to formats used for higher definition video ( e.g. , 720p , 1080i , 1080p , etc . ) , before outputting the signal . By no means , however , will the resulting signal be high - definition video ; that is , aside from optional deinterlacing , upconverting generally consists of merely scaling the video 's dimensions to match that of higher resolution formats , foregoing the scaling that would normally occur in the output device . \n A DVD player has to complete these tasks : \n Fujitsu released the first DVD - ROM - equipped computer on Nov. 6 in GB . Toshiba released a DVD - ROM - equipped computer and a DVD - ROM drive in Japan in early 1997 ( moved back from December which was moved back from November ) . DVD - ROM drives from Toshiba , Pioneer , Panasonic , Hitachi , and Sony began appearing in sample quantities as early as January 1997 , but none were available before May . The first PC upgrade kits ( a combination of DVD - ROM drive and hardware decoder card ) became available from Creative Labs , Hi - Val , and Diamond Multimedia in April and May 1997 . In 2014 , every major PC manufacturer has models that include DVD - ROM drives . \n The first DVD player was created by Sony Corporation in Taiwan in collaboration with Pacific Digital Company from the United States in 1997 . Some manufacturers originally announced that DVD players would be available as early as the middle of 1996 . These predictions were too optimistic . Delivery was initially held up for `` political '' reasons of copy protection demanded by movie studios , but was later delayed by lack of movie titles . The first players appeared in Japan on November 1 , 1996 , followed by U.S. players on March 26 , 1997 with distribution limited to only 7 major cities for the first 6 months . \n In Europe ( but not most other PAL areas ) , SCART connectors are typically used , which can carry composite and analog RGB interlaced video signals ( RGB can be progressive , but not all DVD players and displays support this mode ) or Y / C ( S - Video ) , as well as analog two - channel sound and automatic 4 : 3 or 16 : 9 ( widescreen ) switching on a single convenient multi-wire cable . The analog RGB component signal offers video quality which is superior to S - Video and identical to YPbPr component video . However , analog RGB and S - Video signals can not be carried simultaneously , due to each using the same pins for different uses , and displays often must be manually configured as to the input signal , since no switching mode exists for S - Video . ( A switching mode does exist to indicate whether composite or RGB is being used . ) Some DVD players and set - top boxes offer YPbPr component video signals over the wires in the SCART connector intended for RGB , though this violates the official specification and manual configuration is again necessary . ( Hypothetically , unlike RGB component , YPbPr component signals and S - Video Y / C signals could both be sent over the wire simultaneously , since they share the luminance ( Y ) component . ) \n Video is another issue which continues to present most problems . Current players typically output analog video only , both composite video on an RCA jack as well as S - Video in the standard connector . However , neither of these connectors was intended to be used for progressive video , so yet another set of connectors has started to appear , to carry a form of component video , which keeps the three components of the video , one luminance signal and two color difference signal , as stored on the DVD itself , on fully separate wires ( whereas S - Video uses two wires , uniting and degrading the two color signals , and composite uses only one , uniting and degrading all three signals ) . The connectors are further confused by using a number of different physical connectors on different player models , RCA or BNC , as well as using VGA cables in a non-standard way ( VGA is normally analog RGB -- a different , incompatible form of component video ) . Even worse , there are often two sets of component outputs , one carrying interlaced video , and the other progressive , or an interlaced / progressive switch ( either a physical switch or a menu setting ) . \n The first DVD - Audio players were released in Japan by Pioneer in late 1999 , but they did not play copy - protected discs . Matsushita ( under the Panasonic and Technics labels ) first released full - fledged players in July 2000 for $700 to $1,200 . DVD - Audio players are now also made by Aiwa , Denon , JVC , Kenwood , Madrigal , Marantz , Nakamichi , Onkyo , Toshiba , Yamaha , and others . Sony released the first SACD players in May 1999 for $5,000 . Pioneer 's first DVD - Audio players released in late 1999 also played SACD . SACD players are now also made by Accuphase , Aiwa , Denon , Kenwood , Marantz , Philips , Sharp , and others . \n As of 2014 , retail prices for such a device , depending on its optional features ( such as digital sound or video output ) , start between 30 and 80 USD / Euro . They are usually cheaper than VCRs . \n A DVD player is a device that plays DVD discs produced under both the DVD - Video and DVD - Audio technical standards , two different and incompatible standards . Some DVD players will also play audio CDs . DVD players are connected to a television to watch the DVD content , which could be a movie , a recorded TV show , or other content .",

    "context": "In December 2013 the landmark £ 429 million redevelopment of the Royal Liverpool University Hospital reached financial close ; its collaborative links with the University of Liverpool , and institutes on the Liverpool BioCampus , have given the city of Liverpool recognition as one of the leading UK centres for health research and innovation . The new Royal Liverpool University Hospital , which was designed by NBBJ and HKS and is being built by Carillion , is expected to be the largest all single - patient room hospital in the UK on completion in 2018 . The New Royal is expected to open in the Summer of 2018 . \n Coordinates : 53 ° 24 ′ 34 '' N 2 ° 57 ′ 51 '' W ﻿ / ﻿ 53.40944 ° N 2.96412 ° W ﻿ / 53.40944 ; - 2.96412 \n The Royal Liverpool University Hospital is a major teaching and research hospital for student doctors , nurses , dentists and allied health professionals . The hospital works with the University of Liverpool , Liverpool John Moores University and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine . \n In 2007 , the Healthcare Commission rated Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust `` Good '' for ' Quality of Services ' and Good for ' Use of Resources ' . In 2009 , Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust was rated `` Excellent '' for the quality of its services and the quality of its financial management . \n The Royal Liverpool University Hospital ( RLUH ) is a major teaching and research hospital located in the city of Liverpool , England . Alongside Broadgreen Hospital and Liverpool University Dental Hospital ; the hospital belongs to and operates on behalf of the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust and is associated with the University of Liverpool , Liverpool John Moores University and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine . \n The current Royal Liverpool University Hospital ( RLUH ) opened in 1978 and was designed to replace three other city centre acute hospitals that existed at the time -- the Royal Liverpool Infirmary on Brownlow Street , the David Lewis Northern Hospital on Great Howard Street , and the Royal Southern Hospital on Caryl Street . \n In 1938 the three hospitals , alongside smaller specialist hospitals ( including St Paul 's Eye Hospital on Old Hall Street ) -- had administratively merged under the Royal Liverpool United Hospitals group , and it had long been agreed to eventually amalgamate the separate facilities on a central site within close proximity to the University of Liverpool for the purposes of medical education and research . By 1948 , the site on which the current Royal now stands ( on Prescot Street ) ; was identified for this centralisation as part of the post-war regeneration of Liverpool . However , building on the main hospital did not commence until 1963 . The Royal Liverpool University Hospital was designed and constructed by Holford Associates , between 1963 and 1965 . Its construction was plagued from the outset by problems of cost , time and quality , together with difficulties over fire certification due to changes in health and safety law whilst building work was ongoing . Eventually , the hospital opened in 1978 . \n The Royal Liverpool is the largest and busiest hospital in Merseyside and Cheshire , and has the largest emergency department of its kind in the UK . \n On 10 March 1975 , ITV 's World in Action aired a special film of a 24 - hour shift in the A&E department of the Royal Southern Hospital , one of the three Liverpool city centre hospitals that existed prior to 1978 - the year the RLUH superseded it . The footage documents a typical Saturday night in the casualty department , which the staff call the ' Blood and Guts Shift ' . Although the patient presentations to the department remains largely unchanged - with alcohol intoxication , brawls and mental health problems being the overarching theme ; there is a stark contrast in both culture and practice to the modern NHS which the film encapsulates . Examples include the department only possessing a very small number of beds and the night shift being staffed by only one sister and an anaesthestist , with access being restricted by a locked door . Other footage records the anaesthestist attempting to intubate a conscious and gagging patient who has presented with an overdose ; and infection control and manual handling practices by nursing staff being radically different from what is now considered standard practice .",

    "context": "The Talmud compares the spirit of God to a dove that hovers over the face of the waters . \n Doves , usually white in color , are used in a lot of settings as symbols of love , peace or as messengers . Doves appear in the symbolism of Judaism , Christianity and Paganism , and of both military and pacifist groups . \n In ancient Mesopotamia , doves were prominent animal symbols of Inanna - Ishtar , the goddess of love , sexuality , and war . Doves are shown on cultic objects associated with Inanna as early as the beginning of the third millennium BC . Lead dove figurines were discovered in the temple of Ishtar at Aššur , dating to the thirteenth century BC , and a painted fresco from Mari , Syria shows a giant dove emerging from a palm tree in the temple of Ishtar , indicating that the goddess herself was sometimes believed to take the form of a dove . In the Epic of Gilgamesh , Utnapishtim releases a dove and a raven to find land ; the dove merely circles and returns . Only then does Utnapishtim send forth the raven , which does not return , and Utnapishtim concludes the raven has found land . \n According to the biblical story ( Genesis 8 : 11 ) , a dove was released by Noah after the flood in order to find land ; it came back carrying a freshly plucked olive leaf ( Hebrew : עלה זית alay zayit ) , a sign of life after the Flood and of God 's bringing Noah , his family and the animals to land . Rabbinic literature interpreted the olive leaf as `` the young shoots of the Land of Israel '' or the dove 's preference for bitter food in God 's service , rather than sweet food in the service of men . \n In Christian Iconography , a dove also symbolizes the Holy Spirit , in reference to Matthew 3 : 16 and Luke 3 : 22 where the Holy Spirit is compared to a dove at the Baptism of Jesus . \n The rock dove is , due to its relation to the homing pigeon and thus communications , the main image in the crest of the Tactical Communications Wing , a body within the Royal Air Force . Below the crest is the wing 's motto , `` Ubique Loquimur '' or `` We Speak Everywhere '' . \n Before the Peace of Constantine ( 313 AD ) , in which Rome ceased its persecution of Christians following Constantine 's conversion , Noah was normally shown in an attitude of prayer , a dove with an olive branch flying toward him or alighting on his outstretched hand . According to Graydon Snyder , `` The Noah story afforded the early Christian community an opportunity to express piety and peace in a vessel that withstood the threatening environment '' of Roman persecution . According to Ludwig Budde and Pierre Prigent , the dove referred to the descending of the Holy Spirit rather than the peace associated with Noah . After the Peace of Constantine , when persecution ceased , Noah appeared less frequently in Christian art . \n The use of a dove and olive branch as a symbol of peace originated with the early Christians , who portrayed the act of baptism accompanied by a dove holding an olive branch in its beak and also used the image on their sepulchres . \n Christians derived the symbol of the dove and olive branch from Greek thought , including its use of the symbol of the olive branch , and the story of Noah and the Flood . Although Jews never used the dove as a symbol of peace , it acquired that meaning among early Christians , confirmed by St Augustine of Hippo in his book On Christian Doctrine and became well established . \n In post-biblical Judaism , souls are envisioned as bird - like ( Bahir 119 ) , a concept that may be derived from the Biblical notion that dead spirits `` chirp '' ( Isa. 29 : 4 ) . The Guf , or Treasury of Souls , is sometimes described as a columbarium , a dove cote . This connects it to a related legend : the `` Palace of the Bird 's Nest '' , the dwelling place of the Messiah 's soul until his advent ( Zohar II : 8a -- 9a ) . The Vilna Gaon explicitly declares that a dove is a symbol of the human soul ( Commentary to Jonah , 1 ) . The dove is also a symbol of the people Israel ( Song of Songs Rabbah 2 : 14 ) , an image frequently repeated in Midrash . \n Doves are often associated with the concept of peace and pacifism . They often appear in political cartoons , on banners and signs at events promoting peace ( such as the Olympic Games , at various anti-war / anti-violence protests , etc . ) , and in pacifist literature . A person who is a pacifist is sometimes referred to as a dove ( similarly , in American politics , a person who advocates the use of military resources as opposed to diplomacy can be referred to as a hawk ) . Picasso 's lithograph , La Colombe ( The Dove ) , a traditional , realistic picture of a pigeon , without an olive branch , was chosen as the emblem for the World Peace Council in Paris in April 1949 . The dove became a symbol for the peace movement and the ideals of the Communist Party and was used in Communist demonstrations of the period . At the 1950 World Peace Congress in Sheffield , Picasso said that his father had taught him to paint doves , concluding , `` I stand for life against death ; I stand for peace against war . '' At the 1952 World Peace Congress in Berlin , Picasso 's Dove was depicted in a banner above the stage . Anti-communists had their own take on the peace dove : the group Paix et Liberté distributed posters titled La colombe qui fait BOUM ( the dove that goes BOOM ) , showing the peace dove metamorphosing into a Soviet tank . \n In the ancient Levant , doves were used as symbols for the Canaanite mother goddess Asherah . The ancient Greek word for `` dove '' was peristerá , derived from the Semitic phrase peraḥ Ištar , meaning `` bird of Ishtar '' . In classical antiquity , doves were sacred to the Greek goddess Aphrodite , who absorbed this association with doves from Inanna - Ishtar . Aphrodite frequently appears with doves in ancient Greek pottery . The temple of Aphrodite Pandemos on the southwest slope of the Athenian Acropolis was decorated with relief sculptures of doves with knotted fillets in their beaks and votive offerings of small , white , marble doves were discovered in the temple of Aphrodite at Daphni . During Aphrodite 's main festival , the Aphrodisia , her altars would be purified with the blood of a sacrificed dove . Aphrodite 's associations with doves influenced the Roman goddesses Venus and Fortuna , causing them to become associated with doves as well . \n Medieval illuminated manuscripts , such as the Holkham Bible , showed the dove returning to Noah with a branch . Wycliffe 's Bible , which translated the Vulgate into English in the 14th century , uses `` a braunche of olyue tre with greene leeuys '' ( `` a branch of olive tree with green leaves '' ) in Gen. 8 : 11 . In the Middle Ages , some Jewish illuminated manuscripts also showed Noah 's dove with an olive branch , for example , the Golden Haggadah ( about 1420 ) . \n The early Christians in Rome incorporated into their funerary art the image of a dove carrying an olive branch , often accompanied by the word `` Peace '' . It seems that they derived this image from the simile in the Gospels , combining it with the symbol of the olive branch , which had been used to represent peace by the Greeks and Romans . The dove and olive branch also appeared in Christian images of Noah 's ark . The fourth century Vulgate translated the Hebrew alay zayit ( leaf of olive ) in Genesis 8 : 11 as Latin ramum olivae ( branch of olive ) . By the fifth century , Augustine of Hippo wrote in On Christian Doctrine that `` perpetual peace is indicated by the olive branch ( oleae ramusculo ) which the dove brought with it when it returned to the ark '' . \n In the earliest Christian art , the dove represented the peace of the soul rather than civil peace , but from the third century it began to appear in depictions of conflict in the Old Testament , such as Noah and the Ark , and in the Apocrypha , such as Daniel and the lions , the three young men in the furnace , and Susannah and the Elders .",

    "context": "The special appeared occasionally on HBO in the 1980s . It was released on VHS through Vestron Video subsidiary Children 's Video Library in 1983 . It was also seen on the cable channel TV Land , yet has not been aired on any network since . \n Free to Be faced backlash from some conservative religious leaders , including Evangelical author and psychologist James Dobson . Kyle Smith from the New York Post claimed the project emasculated men . A rebuttal to the claim was posted to The Daily Beast . \n Some material here is left out of the TV special and vice versa while other material appears only in the accompanying hardcover book . \n In her 2010 memoir , Growing Up Laughing , Marlo Thomas reflected on the astonishing impact the Free to Be projects had on the culture . \n Different performances than those included in the film -- and not included on the original LP / CD \n Free to Be ... You and Me was a children 's entertainment project , conceived , created and executive - produced by actress and author Marlo Thomas . Produced in collaboration with the Ms. Foundation for Women , it was a record album and illustrated book first released in November 1972 featuring songs and stories sung or told by celebrities of the day ( credited as `` Marlo Thomas and Friends '' ) including Alan Alda , Rosey Grier , Cicely Tyson , Carol Channing , Michael Jackson , Shirley Jones , Jack Cassidy , and Diana Ross . An ABC special , also created by Marlo Thomas , using poetry , songs , and sketches followed two years later in March 1974 . The basic concept was to encourage post-1960s gender neutrality , saluting values such as individuality , tolerance , and comfort with one 's identity . A major thematic message is that anyone -- whether a boy or a girl -- can achieve anything . \n Well - known songs include `` It 's All Right to Cry , '' sung by football hero Rosey Grier ; the title track by the New Seekers ; `` Helping , '' a Shel Silverstein poem performed by Tom Smothers ; `` Sisters and Brothers '' by the Voices of East Harlem ; and `` When We Grow Up '' performed by Diana Ross on the album and by Roberta Flack and a teenage Michael Jackson on the special . \n The original idea to create the album began with Marlo Thomas , who wanted to teach her then - young niece Dionne about life , in particular that it is acceptable to refute or reject the gender stereotypes expressed in children 's books of the period . In an Emmy Legends interview Thomas explains : \n The television special , produced by Marlo Thomas and Free to Be Productions , in association with Teru Murakami - Fred Wolf Films , Inc. and cosponsored by the Ms. Foundation , first aired March 11 , 1974 , on ABC . It earned an 18.6 rating / 27 share and went on to win an Emmy . Sixteen - mm prints of the special were also struck , and some schoolchildren from the 1970s and 1980s remember seeing the television special , or the filmstrip based on the special , in their school during that period . \n The children pictured on the original LP jacket were schoolmates of Abigail , Robin , and David Pogrebin , children of Letty Cottin Pogrebin , then editor of Ms. Most of the children attended Corlears School . \n To commemorate the 40th anniversary of the original project , a book called When We Were Free to Be : Looking Back at a Children 's Classic and the Difference It Made was published . \n Proceeds went to the Ms. Foundation for Women . The album was originally released on Bell Records in 1972 and since 1983 has been available on Arista Records . The album sold nearly 500,000 copies right away . \n I told my sister Terre `` it would take Dionne 30 years to get over it ( traditional stories ) the same as it took all of us . We need to find her some different books to read '' and she said `` You go and find ' em . '' Well there were n't any . And not only that , I was in the bookstore one day looking around and found this one ( picture book ) that showed a pilot on one page and a stewardess on a facing page ( with a caption ) that said `` Boys are pilots , girls are stewardesses . '' Well I nearly had a heart attack right there in the bookstore , so I said `` We 'll make a record for Dionne '' . \n The show won an Emmy and a Peabody , the book became number one on the New York Times best - seller list and the record went gold . We were floored by the impact it all had . My little message for Dionne had gone straight to the hearts of moms and dads and aunties and uncles and , most of all , teachers , who embraced it as a way to teach the kids in their lives a new way of thinking about themselves . \n A Region 1 DVD of the television special was released in November 2001 , and in 2010 , a newly remastered version was released featuring a number of new extras including a deleted scene showcasing Dustin Hoffman . \n `` Marlo Thomas and Friends '' followed Free to Be ... You and Me with a 1988 sequel , Free to Be ... a Family , the first primetime variety show created and produced in both the United States and the Soviet Union . \n In March 2014 , The Paley Center for Media hosted an event commemorating the 40th anniversary of Free to Be , co-moderated by Marlo Thomas and Gloria Steinem , which included many of the participants in the original project . \n Other sketches , some of them animated in the television special , include `` Atalanta , '' co-narrated by Thomas and Alda , a retelling of the ancient Greek legend of Atalanta ; `` Boy Meets Girl '' with Thomas and Mel Brooks providing the voices for puppets , designed , performed and manipulated by Wayland Flowers , resembling human babies , who use cultural gender stereotypes to try to discover which is a boy and which a girl ; `` William 's Doll '' , based on Charlotte Zolotow 's picture book about a boy whose family resists his requests for a doll until his grandmother explains that William wishes to practice being a good father ; and `` Dudley Pippin '' with Robert Morse and Billy De Wolfe , based on stories by Phil Ressner . \n Produced by Carole Hart , with music produced by Stephen J. Lawrence and Bruce Hart , with stories and poems directed by Alan Alda , the album sold nearly a half a million copies right away after label executives had an original sales expectation of maybe selling 15,000 copies tops . Since then , the title has nearly doubled that figure and is well on its way to being a platinum seller as of 2016 according to Soundscan . It has never been out of print .",

    "context": "Some exterior filming took place at Painshill , a centuries - old landscape park in Surrey . One of the original remaining structures , an abbey , served as the backdrop for the Pairing Day ceremony scene . The instrumental soundtrack for `` Hang the DJ '' was created by Alex Somers , with two pieces contributed by Sigur Rós . \n Charlie Booker was nominated for `` Writing : Drama '' for the 2018 British Academy Television Awards for his screenplay for `` Hang the DJ '' . \n According to Annabel Jones , the series ' co-creator , `` Hang the DJ '' was intended to reflect on the state of dating in the present day and the `` general sense of loneliness '' . Charlie Brooker came up with the idea of the dating app by analogy with Spotify : it determines one 's perfect mate by running through a `` playlist '' of prospective partners and evaluating one 's responses to each partner until the algorithm finds the best match . One challenge with the episode was to keep the twist -- that most of the events took place within a computer simulation -- unclear until the very end while still providing enough detail to make the viewer aware that something was off with the setting . Another aspect Brooker and his writers discussed was how long to have the semi-permanent relationship between Amy and Frank last . They ultimately settled on five years . Brooker said that when Frank discovers this time period `` it 's not devastating news , but it 's not forever '' , and he thinks , `` ' Okay that 's a reasonable amount of time for a serious relationship , a serious bond . ' '' \n Whilst series one and two of Black Mirror were shown on Channel 4 in the UK , in September 2015 Netflix commissioned the series for 12 episodes , and in March 2016 it outbid Channel 4 for the rights to distribute the third series , with a bid of $40 million . The 12 - episode order was divided into two series of six episodes each . \n Amy ( Georgina Campbell ) and Frank ( Joe Cole ) are two of many people in a walled - off System who are placed by a digital companion , Coach ( voiced by Gina Bramhill ) , into trial romantic relationships with others . Coach dictates how long partners can spend together , collects their data , and helps them find their `` ultimate compatible other '' . Amy and Frank meet for just 12 hours before being paired off with others . After a few brief encounters , they realise they are in love , and try to rebel against Coach and the System . \n In May 2017 , a Reddit post unofficially announced the names and directors of the six episodes in series 4 of Black Mirror . The first trailer for the series was released by Netflix on 25 August 2017 , and contained the six episode titles . \n Amy and Frank reconnect at a pairing day celebration , which they attend with their respective partners . After this encounter , Amy begins to distance herself from Lenny . When her relationship with Lenny expires , Amy is assigned to a string of short relationships that become increasingly meaningless . When Frank 's relationship with Nicola expires , Amy and Frank are once again matched and agree not to check their relationship length . \n Beginning on 24 November 2017 , Netflix published a series of posters and trailers for the fourth series of the show , referred to as the `` 13 Days of Black Mirror '' . On 6 December , Netflix published a trailer featuring an amalgamation of scenes from the fourth series , which announced that the series would be released on 29 December . \n Amy is assigned a nine - month long relationship with Lenny ( George Blagden ) , an attractive `` old hand '' at the system . Frank is assigned a one - year relationship with the humourless and dour Nicola ( Gwyneth Keyworth ) . \n Frank ( Joe Cole ) is instructed by `` Coach '' , an artificial intelligence system installed on a small , circular tablet , to go to `` the Hub '' , a large , mall - like building . There he enters a restaurant where he is joined by Amy ( Georgina Campbell ) , who is also following Coach 's instructions . The two discover that it is the first time each of them has met someone through `` the System '' , which dictates which romantic relationships its users will have and for how long . Amy and Frank check their tablets and find that they have 12 hours together . \n After another string of indistinguishable short relationships , Coach informs Amy that her ultimate match has been found , and that her pairing day will be the following day . Coach tells Amy that her ultimate match is someone Amy has never met before , and gives Amy the chance to say farewell to one person of her choosing . Amy quickly chooses to say farewell to Frank , then throws her tablet into a pool . The two meet at the restaurant in the Hub and discover their farewell period is just 90 seconds . Amy confirms with Frank that neither of them remembers what their life was like before they entered the System . She tells Frank that they must be undergoing a test , and that rebelling against the System is part of passing it . They agree to rebel by climbing the encircling wall , and start to leave the restaurant . A guard tries to stop them with a stun gun . Amy defies the guard by putting her hand on the stun gun , which freezes him and everyone else in the restaurant . The two make it to the wall . As they climb it , the lights below them go out and pixelated blackness engulfs everything , revealing that they were part of a simulation . They reappear on a virtual plaza with the number 998 above their heads , surrounded by hundreds of other similarly numbered duplicates of themselves . They look up and fade out of existence in awe , as a digital counter announces that out of 1000 simulations run , 998 rebellions have occurred . \n The camera then flips into the real world , where the System and its simulations are all part of an online dating app 's matchmaking algorithm , with the app on their phones scanning everybody around them and identifying Amy and Frank as a 99.8 % match . Amy and Frank smile at each other , as the lyrics `` Hang the DJ '' from the chorus of `` Panic '' by The Smiths plays in the background , and Amy begins to approach Frank . \n Amy and Frank are taken to a numbered house , passing an encircling wall on the way . They talk , then sleep next to each other , parting the next morning after their tablets count down their relationship time to zero . In their separate conversations with Coach , it is revealed that the System enters users into numerous relationships and collects data on them in order to match the user with their `` ultimate compatible other '' on the user 's `` pairing day '' , which it claims to do with a 99.8 % success rate . \n As Amy and Frank 's relationship continues , Frank becomes distracted by the fact that their relationship has a set end date . He breaks his promise to Amy and checks his tablet to see how long they have left . It initially says five years , but then `` recalibrates '' to ever - shorter periods . Coach informs Frank that his `` one - sided observation '' of the expiration date has shortened his and Amy 's relationship . The tablet eventually settles on 20 hours . The next day , Amy confronts Frank about his distracted behaviour . Frank admits that he checked their expiry date and tells Amy they only have an hour left . The two argue , with Frank suggesting that they climb the encircling wall and escape the System , and are approached by a security guard carrying a stun gun . Amy leaves Frank , angry at him for breaking their promise and `` breaking '' their relationship . \n `` Hang the DJ '' is the fourth episode of the fourth series of anthology series Black Mirror . It was written by Charlie Brooker and directed by Tim Van Patten . The episode first aired on Netflix , along with the rest of series four , on 29 December 2017 . \n The episode received critical acclaim for its simple , satisfying storyline and Campbell and Cole 's performances . Critics praised the Tinder and Siri - like technologies explored throughout the episode and its ending . Some compared the episode to the uplifting tone of `` San Junipero '' .",

    "context": "When it was Davos ' time to enter the tournament , he was approached by the Prince of Orphans to reveal his new Warrior 's name since he was representing Kun - Zi for the first time , to which he chose `` the Steel Phoenix '' . Davos now displays wings at either side of his serpent tattoo to mirror this . \n The second Steel Serpent , Davos , debuted in Iron Fist # 1 ( 1975 ) and was created by Chris Claremont and John Byrne . \n Davos ' spirit was cast into a realm accessible from the Anomaly Gem , and through that Davos used the Contemplator to gather the fragments of the Anomaly Gem and release himself . Then , he again battled Iron Fist and stole his power ; Davos then returned to K'un - L'un and took over the city . Lei Kung allied with Iron Fist , who defeated Davos and restored Yu - Ti 's rule . \n Early in the tournament , Davos faced Tiger 's Beautiful Daughter . During the contest , she severed Davos ' hand . Enraged , Davos concentrated his chi into a new hand and proceeded to viciously beat his opponent to near - death , even refusing to let her yield . The next day , the old and wise Prince of Orphans challenged Davos to a fight instead of his scheduled opponent , Fat Cobra . Davos accepted and watched as his opponent turned into a green mist of chi and was swiftly dispatched by the old fighter , who then declared such brutal tactics as Davos ' would not be acceptable for future matches . \n Davos also utilized the fiery energies of the Serpent 's Sting , though that may be a function of the taloned gloves he wore at the time . When slain , Davos spirit is transferred into the Anomaly Gem alongside the spirits of all past Iron Fists . From there he can be resurrected under certain circumstances . \n The Steel Serpent is a native of K'un - L'un named Davos , the son of Lei Kung the Thunderer . A gifted student of the martial arts , Davos was one of the final two candidates for the right to challenge for the power of the Iron Fist but was defeated in single combat by Wendell Rand , adopted son of K'un - L'un's ruler , Lord Tuan . Davos accused Tuan of unfairly favoring his son and left the city without permission to confront the dragon Shou - Lao . Failing to defeat the dragon , he returned to K'un L'un in disgrace and was exiled to Earth . Wendell Rand left K'un - L'un the same day without having confronted the dragon. 20 years later , Wendell 's son Daniel Rand succeeded in winning the Iron Fist power and soon afterwards also returned to Earth . Davos tracked Iron Fist to New York and stole his power , possessing it until it consumed him and Iron Fist absorbed it back into himself . \n Since taking on the nom de guerre of the Steel Phoenix , Davos has been able to perform the Steel Phoenix Blow . The first time he executed this move , it allowed him to create a replacement hand ( for the one just cut off by Tiger 's Beautiful Daughter ) out of pure chi . \n Later , Davos took part in the rebellion of K'un - L'un , after his father forced him to recognise the potential treachery of his allies by asking him to consider the possibility that there might another angle that he had not anticipated rather than constantly assuming that he was always right . He helped defeat Yu - Ti , leader of K'un - L'un , and began a process of redeeming himself in the eyes of his peers . His father , Lei Kung the Thunderer , who has taken over leadership of K'un - L'un , charged him with guarding a dragon egg , from which Shou - Lao the Undying shall be reborn for the next Iron Fist to fight . \n Davos is portrayed by Sacha Dhawan in the Netflix television series Iron Fist , set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe . \n Crane Mother sent over a dozen daughters to Steel Serpent , along with the warning that if he failed , they would consume his immortal soul . Davos led HYDRA agents and the Crane daughters to Rand Corporation HQ to kidnap Jerryn Hogarth for Xao , but Luke Cage and the Daughters of the Dragon were already there to protect Hogarth . When the Iron Fists arrived outside Rand HQ , they were confronted in the street by Davos ' army . Maintaining his power by consuming the Crane daughters ' life forces , Davos eventually attacked Orson Randall , who let Davos kill him so he would not have to keep running ( or so he said at the time but his true motivation would only be revealed much later ) . Randall gave Rand his chi , enabling him to drive off Davos , who vowed to face him again in the Tournament of the Heavenly Cities . \n The Steel Serpent is a master of the martial arts of K'un - Lun , including those practiced millennia ago . His skills rival those of Iron Fist ( Daniel Rand - K'ai ) and he has several times bested Daniel in combat , though usually with the element of surprise on his side . He is very strong , fast , agile and tough with lightning quick reflexes and reactions . He has proved capable of draining the power of the Iron Fist ( the energies of Shou - Lao ) from its wielder by pressing his serpentine tattoo against the wielder 's dragon tattoo . On at least one occasion he retained some fragment of Shou - Lao 's power after the previous holder of the Iron Fist had reclaimed his power . At his full power he has weathered assaults from the superhumanly powerful Spider - Man . \n Davos was restored by the Crane Mother , promising to locate and destroy the renegade Iron Fist Orson Randall in return . His power was further enhanced via the consumption of the life forces of the Crane Mother 's daughters . Davos allied with HYDRA against Iron Fist in a plot to obtain Rand - Meachum 's Randrapid train to build a tunnel through the K'un - Lun mountains . Davos located Randall in an opium den in Bangkok , Thailand and reported this to the Crane Mother , who sent a pair of her daughters to investigate . Agents of Davos , posing as NYPD , picked up Randall as he arrived in a US airport , but Randall determined the truth and broke free . Davos met with Xao , spokesman for HYDRA 's front company , Wai - Go , expressing his displeasure at HYDRA 's failure . After slaying a HYDRA agent who had failed to engage Iron Fist , Davos sent other agents to bring in both Orson Randall and Daniel Rand . Slaughtering a group of HYDRA agents in a training session , Davos then took out two whole legions of HYDRA agents and destroyed a Mechagorgon . He then contacted the Crane Mother , asking for a dozen or more daughters to allow him to reach his power 's peak to stop his foes . Crane Mother agreed to the request . \n Steel Serpent ( Davos ) is a fictional character , a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics . The character is usually depicted as an enemy of Iron Fist . \n The first , otherwise unnamed , Steel Serpent appeared in The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu # 10 ( 1974 ) , his only appearance , and was created by Tony Isabella and Frank McLaughlin .",

    "context": "Energy in India describes energy and electricity production , consumption and import in India . Energy policy of India describes the policies and strategies of India for achieving sustainable energy security to its people . Electricity sector in India is the main article of electricity in India . The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy provides data regarding progress in the non-conventional energy sector . \n According to Greenpeace the largest coal belt in India is at Jharia . Before coal mining Jharia had forests inhabited by tribes . In 1971 the coal mines were nationalised . Bharat Coking Coal Limited ( BCCL ) took over Jharia coal mines . \n Nearly 8.9 million tons Liquefied Petroleum Gas ( LPG ) was consumed during April to September 2016 ( six months ) in domestic sector mainly for cooking . The number of domestic connections are 215 million ( one connection for six people ) with a circulation of more than 250 million LPG cylinders whose net aggregate length would form a 125,000 km long pipe line which is more than the length of total railway track laid in India . Most of the LPG requirement is imported . Piped city gas supply in India is not yet developed on major scale . \n Since 2013 , total primary energy consumption in India has been the third highest in the world after China and the United States . India is the second top coal consumer in the year 2015 after China . India ranks third in oil consumption with 195.5 million tons in 2015 after the United States and China . India is net energy importer to meet nearly 45 % of its total primary energy . \n Huge quantity of imported coal is being used in pulverised coal - fired power stations . Raw biomass is not suitable for use in the pulverised coal mills as they are difficult to grind into fine powder due to caking problem . However 100 % biomass can be fired after Torrefaction in the pulverised coal mills for replacing imported coal . Torrefied biomass plants can be integrated with existing pulverised coal - fired power stations using the available hot flue gas as heat source . Cofiring dry biomass up to 20 % heat input with coal is also possible directly in pulverised coal - fired power stations without facing caking problem . North west and southern regions can replace imported coal use with biomass where surplus agriculture / crop residue biomass is burnt in the fields causing pollution problems . As traditional use of biomass is being replaced by LPG at faster pace , biomass burning in agriculture fields would become major source for causing higher level air pollution . \n India accounts for the world 's greatest concentration of coal seam fires . Mine area suffers from pollution of air , water and land . \n India was the third top coal producer in 2015 with 283.9 Mtoe ( 7.4 % global share ) . Nearly 80 % of total electricity generated ( utility and captive ) in India is from coal . \n India was the fourth top net crude oil ( including crude oil products ) importer of 163 Mt in 2015 . India has 4.561 million barrels per day ( 5.7 % of the world ) crude oil refinery capacity which is ranked 4th globally . \n India was the third top electricity producer in the world 1272 TWh in FY 2014 -- 15 . By 2013 , India became the world 's third largest producer of electricity with 4.8 % global share , surpassing Japan and Russia . India ranks 7th globally in hydropower generation during the year 2015 . \n Biomass is a renewable energy source and its use for energy generation is carbon - neutral fuel . It is carbon neutral because it would also release global warming green house gasses like methane and carbon dioxide when it is left to degenerate without using as energy source . Presently , only 40 % of house holds in India use biomass and charcoal for cooking purpose as LPG use for cooking purpose is rising rapidly . In addition biomass is also used marginally in commercial cooking , electricity generation , process industries , etc . The total biomass use in India is nearly 177 Mtoe in the year 2013 . Substantial surplus crop residue is also burnt in agriculture fields for clearing the land for the next crop . Nearly 750 million tons of non edible ( by cattle ) biomass is available annually in India which can be put to use for higher value addition . \n India : Total primary energy use of 723.9 Mtoe ( excluding traditional biomass use ) in the calendar year 2016",

    "context": "DeWalt tools on sale in China \n After buying the company in 1949 , American Machine & Foundry Co. , Inc. sold it to Black & Decker in 1960 . \n On September 1 , 2016 , DeWalt debuted an industry - first hybrid voltage battery pack it branded `` FLEXVOLT '' . The pack runs at either 20V ( 18V nominal ) or 60V ( 54V nominal ) depending upon whether it is placed into a 60V FlexVolt tool or one of their 20V Max tools . The pack switches between connecting the battery cells in series ( 60V , 2Ah ) or parallel ( 20V , 6Ah ) depending upon the activated pin configuration determined by the power tool . \n In 1992 , Black & Decker started a major effort to rebrand its professional quality and high - end power tools to DeWalt . Currently , DeWalt manufactures and sells more than 200 different power hand - tools and 800 accessories . In 1994 , DeWalt took over the German wood - working power tool producer ELU . DeWalt increased their line of tools using ELU 's technology . DeWalt is now a popular brand of tools for commercial contractors . \n The original company was started in 1923 by Raymond E. DeWalt , the inventor of the radial arm saw . The company grew quickly and was reorganized and re-incorporated in 1947 as DeWalt Inc . \n A DeWalt screw gun , used for countersinking drywall screws . \n In 2013 , DeWalt issued a press release stating it would be bringing some assembly of a small selection of their products to the US using globally manufactured parts from Brazil , China , the Czech Republic , Italy , Mexico , the UK , and the US . The products assembled in the US would be branded under the label , `` Built in the USA with global materials . '' \n Black & Decker was long associated with lighter - weight consumer tools such as household appliances , and not the heavy - duty equipment professional builders want . In the late 1980s Michael Hammes , executive vice president and president of the company 's power tools and home improvement group , introduced the `` Acura concept , '' a notion Honda utilized to enter the upscale automobile market . Black & Decker found it useful to relinquish a name with little appeal to many consumers in the market for construction tools . \n In 2011 , DeWalt launched a line of contractors ' hand tools ( including utility knives , pliers , adjustable wrenches , tape measures , saws , and hammers ) . In 2013 , the line was expanded to include mechanics ' tools ( wrenches , ratchets , and sockets ) . \n DeWalt Tools sponsored NASCAR driver Matt Kenseth from 1999 through to the 2009 season . In this time period , Kenseth won 18 races , the 2000 Sprint Cup Rookie of the Year Award , 2003 Sprint Cup Series Championship , 2004 Sprint Cup All Star Race and the 2009 Daytona 500 . However , in July 2009 , DeWalt announced that they would not be renewing their sponsorship deal with Kenseth and Roush Fenway Racing due to the poor economic conditions in the construction industry . DeWalt had also sponsored MotoGP rider , Ben Spies , for the 2010 racing season . DeWalt returned to NASCAR sponsorship in 2011 , but on the # 9 Richard Petty Motorsports Ford Fusion driven by Marcos Ambrose . This sponsorship ended after 2014 , when Ambrose departed the Sprint Cup Series , with DeWalt choosing to re-unite with Kenseth , who now drives the # 20 for Joe Gibbs Racing , for six races in 2015 and 15 races in 2017 and beyond . \n In April 2016 , DeWalt created an Android - powered smartphone designed for building industry workers . The device costs £ 379 ( $544 ) , is designed to survive a 2m drop onto concrete and can operate in temperatures ranging from − 20C to 60C . \n DeWalt was acquired in 1960 and continued to produce radial arm saws and other large , stationary , power equipment , Black & Decker expanded the DeWalt name and used this to replace their `` Construction Grade '' trademark in 1992 . In a US - wide market survey done by Black & Decker before its reintroduction , the name DeWalt was recognized by 70 percent of tradesmen . The black and yellow DeWalt design , often associated with safety equipment and advertised on display , helped propel Black & Decker 's profits to new heights . \n Black & Decker divested itself of the radial arm saw manufacturing branch in 1989 , selling it to two executives . Radial arm saws that use the original DeWalt design can still be obtained from the Original Saw Co . \n DeWalt ( trademarked as DᴇWALT ) is an American worldwide brand of power tools and hand tools for the construction , manufacturing and woodworking industries . DeWalt is a trade name of Black & Decker ( U.S. ) Inc. , a subsidiary of Stanley Black & Decker . \n As of 2015 , DeWalt has seven manufacturing facilities building DeWalt branded products in the US : New Britain , CT , Hampstead , MD , Shelbyville , KY , Greenfield , IN , Cheraw , SC , Charlotte , NC , and Jackson , TN . \n In 2004 , Black and Decker bought rival power tool manufacturer Porter - Cable and combined it with DeWalt in Jackson , Tennessee .",

    "answers": "",
    "context": "Another important extension of EOQ model is to consider items with imperfect quality . Salameh and Jaber ( 2000 ) are the first to study the imperfect items in an EOQ model very thoroughly . They consider an inventory problem in which \n Total Cost = purchase cost or production cost + ordering cost + holding cost \n The single - item EOQ formula finds the minimum point of the following cost function : \n Number of orders per year ( based on EOQ ) = 10000 400 = 25 ( \\ displaystyle = ( \\ frac ( 10000 ) ( 400 ) ) = 25 ) \n Malakooti ( 2013 ) has introduced the multi-criteria EOQ models where the criteria could be minimizing the total cost , Order quantity ( inventory ) , and Shortages . \n A version of the model , the Baumol - Tobin model , has also been used to determine the money demand function , where a person 's holdings of money balances can be seen in a way parallel to a firm 's holdings of inventory . \n The required parameters to the solution are the total demand for the year , the purchase cost for each item , the fixed cost to place the order and the storage cost for each item per year . Note that the number of times an order is placed will also affect the total cost , though this number can be determined from the other parameters . \n Recently an interesting similarity between EOQ of Melon picking and fuel injection in Gasoline Direction Injection has been proposed . \n An important extension to the EOQ model is to accommodate quantity discounts . There are two main types of quantity discounts : ( 1 ) all - units and ( 2 ) incremental . Here is a numerical example : \n If we check the total cost for any order quantity other than 400 ( = EOQ ) , we will see that the cost is higher . For instance , supposing 500 units per order , then \n Similarly , if we choose 300 for the order quantity then \n Economic order quantity = 2 D ∗ K h ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ sqrt ( \\ frac ( 2D * K ) ( h ) ) ) ) = 2 ∗ 10000 ∗ 40 5 ( \\ displaystyle = ( \\ sqrt ( \\ frac ( 2 * 10000 * 40 ) ( 5 ) ) ) ) = 400 units \n Total cost = 50 ∗ 10000 + 40 ∗ ( 10000 / 300 ) + 5 ∗ ( 300 / 2 ) = 502083.33 ( \\ displaystyle = 50 * 10000 + 40 * ( 10000 / 300 ) + 5 * ( 300 / 2 ) = 502083.33 ) \n In presence of a strategic customer , who responds optimally to discount schedule , the design of optimal quantity discount scheme by the supplier is complex and has to be done carefully . This is particularly so when the demand at the customer is itself uncertain . An interesting effect called the `` reverse bullwhip '' takes place where an increase in consumer demand uncertainty actually reduces order quantity uncertainty at the supplier . \n Total cost = P ∗ D + K ( D / E O Q ) + h ( E O Q / 2 ) ( \\ displaystyle = P * D + K ( D / EOQ ) + h ( EOQ / 2 ) ) \n 0 = − D K Q 2 + h 2 ( \\ displaystyle ( 0 ) = - ( \\ frac ( DK ) ( Q ^ ( 2 ) ) ) + ( \\ frac ( h ) ( 2 ) ) ) \n A version taking the time - value of money into account was developed by Trippi and Lewin . \n Total cost = 50 ∗ 10000 + 40 ∗ ( 10000 / 400 ) + 5 ∗ ( 400 / 2 ) = 502000 ( \\ displaystyle = 50 * 10000 + 40 * ( 10000 / 400 ) + 5 * ( 400 / 2 ) = 502000 ) \n We want to determine the optimal number of units to order so that we minimize the total cost associated with the purchase , delivery and storage of the product . \n The optimal value Q * may also be found by recognising that \n the demand is deterministic and there is a fraction of imperfect items in the lot and are screened by the buyer and sold by them at the end of the circle at discount price . Imperfect quality items have also been considered in a decentralized supply chain and the problem has also been studied with game theoretical models . \n Q * is independent of P ; it is a function of only K , D , h . \n Q ∗ 2 = 2 D K h ( \\ displaystyle Q ^ ( * 2 ) = ( \\ frac ( 2DK ) ( h ) ) ) \n EOQ applies only when demand for a product is constant over the year and each new order is delivered in full when inventory reaches zero . There is a fixed cost for each order placed , regardless of the number of units ordered . There is also a cost for each unit held in storage , commonly known as holding cost , sometimes expressed as a percentage of the purchase cost of the item . \n T C = P D + D K Q + h Q 2 ( \\ displaystyle TC = PD+ ( \\ frac ( DK ) ( Q ) ) + ( \\ frac ( hQ ) ( 2 ) ) ) . \n Solving for Q gives Q * ( the optimal order quantity ) : \n This illustrates that the economic order quantity is always in the best interests of the firm . \n In inventory management , economic order quantity ( EOQ ) is the order quantity that minimizes the total holding costs and ordering costs . It is one of the oldest classical production scheduling models . The model was developed by Ford W. Harris in 1913 , but R.H. Wilson , a consultant who applied it extensively , and K. Andler are given credit for their in - depth analysis . \n To determine the minimum point of the total cost curve , calculate the derivative of the total cost with respect to Q ( assume all other variables are constant ) and set it equal to 0 : \n Total cost = 50 ∗ 10000 + 40 ∗ ( 10000 / 500 ) + 5 ∗ ( 500 / 2 ) = 502050 ( \\ displaystyle = 50 * 10000 + 40 * ( 10000 / 500 ) + 5 * ( 500 / 2 ) = 502050 ) \n T C = D K Q + h Q 2 + P D = h 2 Q ( Q − 2 D K / h ) 2 + 2 h D K + P D , ( \\ displaystyle TC = ( \\ frac ( DK ) ( Q ) ) + ( \\ frac ( hQ ) ( 2 ) ) + PD = ( \\ frac ( h ) ( 2Q ) ) ( Q - ( \\ sqrt ( 2DK / h ) ) ) ^ ( 2 ) + ( \\ sqrt ( 2hDK ) ) + PD , ) where the non-negative quadratic term disappears for Q = 2 D K / h , ( \\ displaystyle Q = ( \\ sqrt ( 2DK / h ) ) , ) which provides the cost minimum T C m i n = 2 h D K + P D . ( \\ displaystyle TC_ ( min ) = ( \\ sqrt ( 2hDK ) ) + PD . ) \n Several extensions can be made to the EOQ model , including backordering costs and multiple items . Additionally , the economic order interval can be determined from the EOQ and the economic production quantity model ( which determines the optimal production quantity ) can be determined in a similar fashion .",

    "context": "In his autobiography , Sutton denied originating the pithy rejoinder : \n The Redlands Daily Facts published the earliest documented example of Sutton 's law on March 15 , 1952 in Redlands , California . \n Sentenced to life imprisonment as a fourth time offender , Sutton was transferred to the Philadelphia County Prison , Holmesburg section of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . On February 10 , 1947 , Sutton and other prisoners dressed as prison guards carried two ladders across the prison yard to the wall after dark . When the prison 's searchlights hit him , Sutton yelled , `` It 's all right ! '' No one stopped him . \n He became a criminal at an early age , though throughout his professional criminal career , he did not kill anyone . Described by Mafioso Donald Frankos as `` a little bright - eyed guy , just 5'7 '' and always talking , chain - smoking ... cigarettes with Bull Durham tobacco . '' Frankos stated also that Sutton `` dispensed mounds of legal advice '' to any convict willing to listen . Inmates considered Sutton a `` wise old head '' in the prison population . When incarcerated at `` The Tombs '' ( Manhattan House of Detention ) he did not have to worry about assault because Mafia friends protected him . In conversation with Donald Frankos he would sadly reminisce about the 1920s and 1930s when he was most active in robbing banks and would always tell fellow convicts that in his opinion , during the days of Al Capone and Charles Luciano , better known as Lucky Luciano , the criminals were the bloodiest . Gangsters from the time period , and many incarcerated organized crime inmates , enjoyed having Sutton for companionship . He was witty and non-violent . Frankos declared that Sutton made legendary bank thieves Jesse James and John Dillinger seem like amateurs . \n William Francis `` Willie '' Sutton , Jr . ( June 30 , 1901 -- November 2 , 1980 ) was an American bank robber . During his forty - year robbery career he stole an estimated $2 million , and he eventually spent more than half of his adult life in prison and escaped three times . For his talent at executing robberies in disguises , he gained two nicknames , `` Willie the Actor '' and `` Slick Willie '' . Sutton is also known as the namesake of the so - called Sutton 's law , although he denied originating it . \n If anybody had asked me , I 'd have probably said it . That 's what almost anybody would say ... it could n't be more obvious . \n Judge Peter T. Farrell presided over a 1952 trial in which Sutton was convicted of the 1950 robbery of $63,942 ( equal to $650,387 presently ) from a bank of the Manufacturers Trust Company in Sunnyside , Queens . He received a sentence of 30 to 120 years in Attica State Prison . \n Sutton also conducted a Broadway jewelry store robbery in broad daylight , impersonating a postal telegraph messenger . Sutton 's other disguises included a police officer , messenger and maintenance man . He usually arrived at banks or stores shortly before they opened for business . \n A famous apocryphal story is that Sutton was asked by reporter Mitch Ohnstad why he robbed banks . According to Ohnstad , he replied , `` Because that 's where the money is '' . The quote evolved into Sutton 's law , which is often invoked to medical students as a metaphor for emphasizing the most likely diagnosis , rather than wasting time and money investigating every conceivable possibility . \n During December 1969 , in response to a motion by Sutton 's attorneys , Farrell ruled that Sutton 's good behavior in prison and his deteriorating health due to emphysema justified commutation of his sentence to time served . At the hearing Sutton responded , `` Thank you , your Honor . God bless you , '' and wept as he was led out of the court building . During 1970 , a separate 30 - years - to - life sentence given in Brooklyn during 1952 was also commuted on similar grounds , and he was released to parole . \n A series of decisions by the United States Supreme Court during the 1960s resulted in his release on Christmas Eve , 1969 , from Attica State Prison . He was in ill health at the time , suffering from emphysema and in need of an operation on the arteries of his legs . \n A corollary , the `` Willie Sutton rule , '' used in management accounting , stipulates that activity - based costing ( in which activities are prioritized by necessity , and budgeted accordingly ) should be applied where the greatest costs occur , because that is where the greatest savings can be found . \n During February 1952 , Sutton was captured by police after having been recognized on a subway and followed by Arnold Schuster , a 24 - year - old Brooklyn clothing salesman and amateur detective . Schuster later appeared on television and described how he had assisted in Sutton 's apprehension . Albert Anastasia , Mafia boss of the Gambino crime family , disliked Schuster because he was a `` rat '' and a `` squealer '' . According to Mafia renegade and first major government informant , Joe Valachi , Anastasia ordered the murder of Schuster , who was then shot dead outside his home on March 9 , 1952 . \n Sutton was an accomplished bank robber . He usually carried a pistol or a Thompson submachine gun . `` You ca n't rob a bank on charm and personality , '' he once observed . In an interview in the Reader 's Digest published shortly before his death , Sutton was asked if the guns that he used in his robberies were loaded . He responded that he never carried a loaded gun because somebody might get hurt . He stole from the rich and kept it , though public opinion later made him into a type of Gentleman Thief , like Robin Hood . He allegedly never robbed a bank when a woman screamed or a baby cried . According to writer Pavle Stanimirovic who wrote about Willie Sutton in his new True Crime Stories from behind the wall with Burl Barer , he talks about all the `` old school '' gangsters from `` Mad Dog '' Joe Sulivan , Jimmy `` The Gent '' Burke , John Gotti , and Jimmy Ida . \n Sutton married Louise Leudemann during 1929 . She divorced him while he was in jail . Their daughter Jeanie was born the next year . His second wife was Olga Kowalska , whom he married during 1933 . His longest period of ( legal ) employment lasted for 18 months . \n Sutton was captured and recommitted in June of 1931 , charged with assault and robbery . He failed to complete his 30 - year sentence however , escaping on December 11 , 1932 , using a smuggled gun and holding a prison guard hostage . With the guard as leverage , Sutton acquired a 45 - ft ( 13.5 meter ) ladder to scale the 30 - ft ( 9 meter ) wall of the prison grounds . \n Sutton was born into an Irish - American family on June 30 , 1901 . The family lived on the corner of Gold and Nassau Streets in the neighborhood of Irishtown , Brooklyn , now called Vinegar Hill . According to his biography , `` Where the Money Was '' , at the age of three the family relocated to High Street . His father , William Sutton Sr. , was a blacksmith . His mother was Mary Ellen Bowles and , according to the biography , born in Ireland ; however , according to the 1910 U.S. Census , she was born in Maryland and her parents were born in Ireland . By 1910 , she had given birth to five children , of which three were still alive . According to the 1910 Census , his maternal grandfather , James Bowles , and his two maternal uncles were also living with the family . Sutton was the fourth of five children , and did not attend school after the 8th grade . \n After his release Sutton delivered lectures on prison reform and consulted with banks on theft deterrent techniques . He made a television commercial for New Britain Bank and Trust Company in Connecticut for their credit card with picture identification on it . His lines were , `` They call it the ' face card . ' Now when I say I 'm Willie Sutton , people believe me . '' \n Sutton died in 1980 at the age of 79 ; before this , he had spent his last years with his sister in Spring Hill , Florida . He frequented the Spring Hill Restaurant where he kept to himself . After Sutton 's death , his family arranged a quiet burial in Brooklyn in the family plot . \n On March 20 , 1950 , Sutton was the eleventh listed of the FBI 's FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives , created only a week earlier , on March 14 . \n The irony of using a bank robber 's maxim as an instrument for teaching medicine is compounded , I will now confess , by the fact that I never said it . The credit belongs to some enterprising reporter who apparently felt a need to fill out his copy . I ca n't even remember where I first read it . It just seemed to appear one day , and then it was everywhere . \n Sutton was apprehended on February 5 , 1934 , and was sentenced to serve 25 to 50 years in the Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , for the machine gun robbery of the Corn Exchange Bank . On April 3 , 1945 , Sutton was one of 12 convicts who escaped the institution through a tunnel . Sutton was recaptured the same day by Philadelphia police officer Mark Kehoe . \n On February 15 , 1933 , Sutton attempted to rob the Corn Exchange Bank and Trust Company in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . He came in disguised as a postman , but an alert passerby foiled the crime . Sutton escaped . On January 15 , 1934 , he and two companions broke into the same bank through a skylight . \n Why did I rob banks ? Because I enjoyed it . I loved it . I was more alive when I was inside a bank , robbing it , than at any other time in my life . I enjoyed everything about it so much that one or two weeks later I 'd be out looking for the next job . But to me the money was the chips , that 's all .",

In Mr. Monk and the Captain 's Wife , Sharona noted that she was an R.N. ( at the time of the episode ) and interned with the doctors who were going to operate on Karen Stottlemeyer . In Mr. Monk Gets Fired , she returned to work as a nurse . When Sharona returned in season 8 , she had re-divorced her husband , and was an administrator at a veterans hospital in New Jersey . \n Sharona 's childhood is only mentioned in the season 3 episode `` Mr. Monk and the Girl Who Cried Wolf '' . Her father , Douglas , owned a hardware store and died when she was a child . This left her mother , Cheryl , to raise Sharona and her younger sister , Gail , who is an actress and appears in the episodes `` Mr. Monk and the Earthquake '' and `` Mr. Monk Goes to the Theater '' . \n Sharona made a special guest appearance in Mr. Monk and Sharona , in season 8 , in order to meet her lawyer about a lawsuit involving her uncle , Howard Fleming . In this episode she explained what she had been doing since she left . She meets Natalie Teeger , Monk 's new assistant , and it seems that they are going to get along until it is revealed that Monk paid Sharona $20 a week more than Natalie . Later , they begin to bicker about assisting styles , the settlement money , etc. , The two women later reconile their differences and note that each woman was just what Monk needed at the time they worked for him , and that Sharona 's seeming toughness got Monk to a place where he did n't need a full - time nurse at his side . There was also a surprise hug between Monk and Sharona , which shows the first time Monk has returned a hug given by anyone , and also a surprise kiss between Randy Disher , whom Sharona regularly traded teasing barbs and banter in the first 2.5 seasons . \n In Mr. Monk and the Red Herring , ( season 3.10 ) it is revealed that Sharona had left to return to Jersey with her son , to remarry her ex-husband . In Mr. Monk and Sharona , it is revealed that she and Trevor had divorced again , and that it was probably best for both of them . In this episode , she also begins her relationship with Lt. Randy Disher , who she regularly had verbal banter with . At the end of Mr. Monk and the End , it was shown that Randy and Sharona had found a home together . In some of the later novels , starting with Mr. Monk is on Patrol , her relationship with Randy is fleshed out a bit more . \n Eventually , Monk discovers that Trevor had been framed for the murder . After Monk exonerates him , and Sharona and Natalie -- who also have been framed by Ian Ludlow , the real killer -- Sharona goes back to Trevor . By this point , Sharona and Natalie have become friends and Sharona is sure Monk is in good hands , thus serving more closure than on the television series . The novel ends with Sharona moving back to Los Angeles with Trevor and Benjy , leaving her character in a better position to be able to return into Adrian 's life , e.g. visits , than it would if her character was in New Jersey , perhaps hinting at a possible return of her character . The events of the book run somewhat contrary to how her return was later depicted in `` Mr. Monk and Sharona '' , although some elements of the novel , like Natalie and Sharona 's open hostility towards each other , are adapted over . Both of these crossovers highlight the differences between Natalie and Sharona - Natalie tends to be more accepting of Monk 's compulsions whereas Sharona tries to force Monk to adapt . \n In Mr. Monk and the End , it is revealed that Randy spent 2 weeks on vacation , having landed in Newark , New Jersey ( where Sharona lives ) , and that he and Sharona had found a home which they would share when Randy moves to New Jersey sometime after Monk 's last case . \n In Mr Monk and Sharona , Sharona and Randy started a relationship , seeming to have picked up on the flirting banter they had shared during the first 3 seasons on Monk . It was revealed in Mr. Monk and the End that Randy had spent 2 weeks visiting Sharona , and that he had accepted a job as Police Chief of Summit New Jersey and had found a home to share with Sharona . \n Sharona drives a tan 1990 Volvo 740 GLE Wagon , which in `` Mr. Monk and the 12th Man '' is shown to have 100,000 miles . The counter says 99,999 , prompting Monk to move the car forwards and backwards until the number is even while staking out Henry Small 's house . \n Lee Goldberg 's novel Mr. Monk and the Two Assistants has Sharona returning to San Francisco after Trevor is arrested for allegedly murdering a UCLA professor . Sharona goes back to her position as a registered nurse . Monk and Natalie meet her when they bring Julie to the hospital to be treated for a broken wrist . Sharona plans to return to work with Monk and thus results in open hostility between her and Natalie . \n Sharona Fleming is a fictional character in the USA Network television series Monk . Sharona is a divorced registered nurse from New Jersey and a single mother with a young son named Benjy . She was played by Bitty Schram . Schram was nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance . \n She has ' quit ' her job as Monk 's assistant at least twice ; in the episode `` Mr. Monk and the Candidate '' and `` Mr. Monk and the Billionaire Mugger '' ( this was due to a pay dispute ( her paychecks had bounced regularly ) ; she temporarily got a job at a lamp store ) . Sharona 's ' quitting ' became a running gag in the show , until she finally left in 2004 to remarry her ex-husband , Trevor Howe , following `` Mr. Monk Takes His Medicine '' . This was because Bitty Schram quit the show over contract disputes . Subsequently , Traylor Howard was introduced as Natalie Teeger , Monk 's new assistant , beginning in `` Mr. Monk and the Red Herring '' . \n The season 2 episode `` Mr. Monk Meets the Playboy '' reveals that Sharona had married Trevor out of high school , but it did not last long , leaving her with an infant , Benjy , to raise on her own . When her son Benjy was one , she did some nude modeling under a pseudonym in Atlantic City , revealed to Monk in that episode when playboy Dexter Larsen of Sapphire Magazine threatens to publish these photos to keep Monk from investigating him further . In the season 1 episode `` Mr. Monk Meets Dale the Whale '' Dale `` the Whale '' Biederbeck asks Sharona if she is `` still making house calls , '' to which Sharona replies that `` she does n't do that kinda stuff anymore , '' implying that at one point she used her LPN training to do home health care . \n When Monk becomes a consulting detective , It is revealed in the novel Mr Monk is on Patrol , that one of the criteria that the SFPD had for employing Monk as a consultant was that he had to have Sharona with him , in case he has a breakdown . Sharona helps out , sometimes doing independent investigations and sometimes even using her sex appeal to get information that Monk can not . She also does all kinds of things that Monk 's OCD and phobias prevent him from doing as she has few such reservations herself . However , in the season 2 episode `` Mr. Monk Goes to the Circus , '' Sharona is revealed to have a fear of elephants , due to seeing a girl falling into an elephant pit when she was seven years old . She takes up smoking after Monk reacts insensitively to her fear of elephants , telling her to `` suck it up '' . \n Bitty Schram returned to play Sharona as a guest star in the season 8 episode `` Mr. Monk and Sharona '' In this episode , Sharona returns to San Francisco after the death of her little - known uncle Howard Fleming , to which Monk believes there has been foul play . A primary subplot of the episode is the way that Monk is torn between Natalie 's methods and Sharona 's . Sharona mentions during the episode that she and Trevor have separated permanently , and that Benjy is currently making plans to attend college . It is hinted that Sharona and Randy may be dating . In the final episode of the series , Randy moves to Summit , New Jersey to live with Sharona . \n Sharona is mentioned again after her character left the show in `` Mr. Monk Is On the Run ( Part Two ) '' , having sent flowers for the `` deceased '' Monk and flying in with Benjy to attend his funeral . \n Another Goldberg mystery , Mr. Monk On Patrol , involves her significant other , Disher , act as mayor for several months . Summit has undergone a terrible wave of crime . But , as the San Franciscans grow to be a little hostile to Adrian Monk , Summit 's police department ( which consists of six men ) calls for Monk to solve homicides for a week . Sharona flies to San Francisco to escort Monk and Natalie , whom she had grown hostile with in the earlier Monk episode , to Newark .",

    "gold": "1971",
    "answers": "",
    "context": "Margie Joseph recorded a femme version of the song , titled `` He 's Got a Way , '' in 1974 . Her version uses electric piano as the primary instrument , and adds a Hammond B - 3 organ in the third verse to add a touch of gospel music influence . She also adds a gospel choir for background vocals which , in Bielen 's opinion gives the impression that her interpretation may be directed towards God rather than a human lover . Bernadette Peters covered `` He 's Got a Way '' on her 1996 album I 'll Be Your Baby Tonight , accompanied only on piano . Bielen described this version as being `` technically perfect albeit emotion - filled . '' Erlewine says that she is `` well - suited '' to its `` pseudo-show tune stylings . '' \n Joel originally included `` She 's Got a Way '' on a five - song demo tape that also included other songs that would appear on Cold Spring Harbor such as `` Everybody Loves You Now '' and `` Tomorrow Is Today '' which Joel made in an unsuccessful attempt to secure his first solo recording contract with Paramount Records . \n `` She 's Got a Way '' is a love ballad . The lyrics to `` She 's Got a Way '' have the singer describing how various characteristics of a particular woman , such as her laugh , make him love her , even though he ca n't understand why . To music critic Mark Bego it 's a song about a woman who has `` mesmerized '' him . Joel biographer Fred Schruers describes the lyrics as a `` plainspoken , never - quite - corny adoration of a loved one . '' According to a friend of the couple , Bruce Gentile , the song was written about Joel 's first wife Elizabeth . \n The version released on Songs in the Attic was recorded at a live performance in Boston in 1980 . Joel performs the song with only his piano accompanying him . Ken Bielen describes the performance as being influenced by Paul McCartney 's style and says that the small venue with its `` attentive audience '' provides an `` intense intimacy . '' Schruers describes this version as being `` a technically better performance much more in a chest register '' but does not consider it as poignant as the original version . AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine calls this version `` richer and warmer '' than the studio version . \n `` She 's Got a Way '' is a song by American singer - songwriter Billy Joel , originally released on his first solo album , Cold Spring Harbor ( 1971 ) and as a single from that album in some countries . It was also featured as a single from the 1981 live album Songs in the Attic , peaking at number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in early 1982 . \n Michael Sweet covered this song on 2007 's Touched . Phil Keaggy covered the song on 2007 's Acoustic Café , accompanied only by acoustic guitar . Ken Bielen described this version as being `` sweet , gentle and simple . '' Don Henley sang `` She 's Got a Way '' as a tribute to Joel when Joel was awarded a Kennedy Center Honor in 2013 . \n AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the studio version as being `` lovely '' and rated it as one of Joel 's `` finest songs . '' Bego described it as a `` beautiful love ballad '' and one of Joel 's `` most serious and adult compositions . '' Joel biographer Hank Bordowitz called it a `` remarkable composition that , while not great , at least indicate ( d ) a rising talent . '' Billboard Magazine 's Roy Waddell similarly described it as a `` chestnut '' that did n't get its `` proper due '' until the live version was released on Songs in the Attic . Joel biographer Fred Schruers described as the one `` gem '' from Cold Spring Harbor . According to Rolling Stone Album Guide critic Paul Evans , `` She 's Got a Way '' `` set the pattern for the ballads Joel would soon turn out effortlessly . '' \n In a 1981 interview , Joel expressed mixed feelings about the song : `` I thought it was cornball for years . I had trouble singing it at first . Then I got into it and decided everybody has a corny side , I suppose '' . \n Schruers describes the song 's melody as alternating between `` surging '' and `` relenting . '' The original studio version has minimal instrumentation . The most prominent instruments are Joel 's piano and some cymbal crashes . Schruers describes Joel 's piano playing as `` stately . '' On the 1983 reissue of Cold Spring Harbor , `` She 's Got a Way '' also incorporated strings , which may have been inspired by a live performance at Carnegie Hall in New York City at which strings were included in the instrumentation . Schruers attributes some of the poignance of the song to the way Joel sings the final word of the final phrase `` I do n't know what it is / But there does n't have to be a reason anyway . '' Schruers describes the last word `` anyway '' as hanging in the air , `` trailing off '' and `` disrupting the tempo '' and thus `` seemingly giving in to the emotion '' of love .",

    "context": "On June 19 , 2007 , Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the first season of Silver Spoons on DVD in Region 1 . As of 2015 , this release has been discontinued and is out of print . It is unknown if the remaining 4 seasons will be released . \n In the pilot episode , Ricky Stratton ( Ricky Schroder ) arrives at the mansion of the father he has never met to introduce himself , move in , and get to know him better . Edward Stratton III ( Joel Higgins ) epitomizes the phrase `` overgrown child '' ; he has never taken responsibility for anything in his life , including his toy business , Eddie 's Toys . Ricky recognizes that his father needs to grow up ; Edward thinks his son is too uptight and needs to have more fun while he 's still young . \n Reruns of Silver Spoons aired on NBC 's daytime schedule from July 1 , 1985 to September 20 , 1985 at 10 : 00am ( EST ) . Reruns of the NBC run ( seasons 1 -- 4 ) aired with the first - run syndicated episodes ( season five ) every weekday on local stations , starting in 1986 ; many stations ( such as KTLA in Los Angeles ) elected to air the first - run episodes either Monday or Friday , with episodes from the NBC run filling - out the remaining four weekdays . Webster , another 1980s family sitcom , used that same format when it left ABC for first - run syndication after its fourth season ( 1986 -- 87 ) ; that series ran an additional two seasons ( 1987 -- 89 ) in first - run syndication . \n Edward 's father is played by John Houseman as the thoughtful , well - to - do patriarch and industrialist whose demeanor starkly contrasts with Edward 's and seems more similar to Ricky 's ( at first ) . Throughout the series , the comic tension arises between Grandfather Stratton 's belief that people with money are obligated to make more money and Edward 's belief that money should be used to make people happy . Ricky is often caught between the two , wishing only for peace and harmony within the family . \n FamilyNet ( now The Cowboy Channel ) aired reruns of the series nightly with back - to - back episodes at 9pm Eastern ( and noon ET Mondays - Saturdays ) , until June 30 , 2017 , when the network underwent a programming format change the following day . Antenna TV began airing reruns of the series starting in January 2018 . \n Silver Spoons was created by Martin Cohan , Howard Leeds and Ben Starr . \n The show 's theme song titled `` Together '' was written by Rik Howard and Bob Wirth . The original version was accompanied mostly by guitar with vocals by Ron Dante . Two other versions of the theme were used during the show 's run . A synthesized version was used in 1985 with a different vocalist . The third version of the theme , a rock version , was introduced in 1986 when the show moved to first - run syndication , with vocals again by Ron Dante . \n During the series ' early years , Ricky befriends `` bad boy '' Derek Taylor ( Jason Bateman , seasons 1 -- 2 ) , smooth - talking `` cowboy '' J.T. Martin ( Bobby Fite , seasons 1 -- 2 ) , and `` nerdy '' Freddy Lippincottleman ( Corky Pigeon , seasons 1 -- 4 ) . They get into a lot of trouble and learn many childhood lessons along the way . \n Ricky 's mother is Evelyn Bluedhorn ( Christine Belford ) . Edward and Evelyn 's romantic relationship led to a week - long marriage . Now Evelyn has remarried and placed Ricky in a military boarding school . When Ricky arrives at the Stratton residence , Edward is stunned to discover that his long - ago brief marriage produced a son ( when he expressed incredulousness because he `` was n't married that long , '' Ricky pointed out , `` It does n't take that long '' ) . At first he sends Ricky right back to the boarding school ; later he dresses up as a swamp monster to take Ricky out of the school and back to the mansion to live with him . The mansion is stocked with arcade games and a scale - model freight train runs through it . \n The brick Tudor period mansion shown in the opening credits is actually a private residence located in Warwickshire , England . The elaborate home , named Compton Wynyates , was built in 1481 . Before Silver Spoons , it was used in the 1977 Disney film Candleshoe , starring Helen Hayes , Jodie Foster and David Niven . \n Edward 's original attorney was Leonard Rollins ( Leonard Lightfoot ) , who departed after the first season , and was replaced by the aptly named business manager Dexter Stuffins ( Franklyn Seales ) , who was somewhat stuffier and more erudite than Leonard had been . Dexter remained through the rest of the series and was joined in fall 1984 by his hip , break dancing nephew Alfonso Spears ( Alfonso Ribeiro , seasons 3 -- 5 ) , who became Ricky 's new best friend . Once Ricky , Freddy and Alfonso were in high school in season four , their circle was completed by Brad ( Billy Jacoby , seasons 4 -- 5 ) , a reintroduction of the type of `` bad boy '' - character similar to that of Derek during the show 's early years . That year , as Kate and Edward adjusted to married life , Kate 's doddering uncle , Harry Summers ( Ray Walston ) , moved into the Stratton mansion . \n The show was also reran on WWOR EMI Service from December 28 , 1992 to September 3 , 1993 . Select episodes were also aired on Nick at Nite in 2001 and 2005 . The show is also available on Comcast digital cable 's On Demand service as of September 19 , 2006 . Chicago 's WWME ( `` Me TV '' ) currently airs two episodes back to back on Saturday afternoons . The first season is also available for purchase by episode or season on iTunes . In 2008 , video on demand sites Hulu and Crackle began airing the syndicated version of the first season of Silver Spoons . \n Edward exhibits his childishness and playfulness in many ways , such as performing a little dance while the Pac - Man plays its theme song . Stratton 's personal assistant , Kate Summers ( Erin Gray ) , is often the voice of reason . Kate 's role adds tension to the show and provides incentive for Edward to act more maturely ( at least sometimes ) . Edward and Kate 's will - they - or - wo n't - they relationship gives way to a third - season wedding . \n Silver Spoons is an American sitcom that aired on NBC from September 25 , 1982 to May 11 , 1986 , and in first - run syndication from September 15 , 1986 to March 4 , 1987 . The series was produced by Embassy Television for the first four seasons , until Embassy Communications moved the series to syndication .",

    "context": "Sweet and Lowdown received generally positive reviews ; it currently holds a 78 % ' fresh ' rating on Rotten Tomatoes , with the consensus , `` Critics praise Woody Allen 's Sweet and Lowdown for its charming , light - hearted comedy and quality acting . '' The film carries a 70 on Metacritic indicating generally favorable reviews . \n Sweet and Lowdown is one of the better - received later works by Allen . Penn and Morton both received Oscar nominations , for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress , respectively . \n In 1998 , Allen returned to the project , rewriting the script and dubbing it Sweet and Lowdown . In the role of Emmet Ray , a jazz guitarist whom Allen had originally planned to play himself , the director cast Sean Penn ; Allen also considered Johnny Depp , but the actor was busy at the time . In regard to working with Sean Penn , who had a reputation for being difficult to work with , Allen later said , `` I had no problem with him whatsoever ... He gave it his all and took direction and made contributions himself ... a tremendous actor . '' \n It was the first of three films where Allen collaborated with Chinese cinematographer Zhao Fei . Allen had first noticed Zhao with his award winning work on Raise the Red Lantern , some years earlier . \n Allen 's use of Penn ( and Morton ) paid off when Sweet and Lowdown was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Leading Role ( Sean Penn ) and Best Actress in a Supporting Role ( Samantha Morton ) . Morton 's nomination was especially notable , considering the fact that she does not utter a single word of dialogue in the film . Allen has said that he told Morton to `` play the part like Harpo Marx . And she said , ' Who is Harpo Marx ? ' and I realized how young she was . Then I told her about him ( and ) she went back and saw the films . '' In addition to her Oscar nomination , Morton 's performance was met with critical acclaim , with Salon.com critic Stephanie Zacharek saying that she `` quietly explodes ( the film ) ... Her performance is like nothing I 've seen in recent years . '' \n Hot off his 1969 directing debut Take the Money and Run , Allen signed a contract to direct a series of films with United Artists . Told to `` write what you want to write , '' Allen ( a clarinetist and avid jazz enthusiast ) wrote The Jazz Baby , a dramatic screenplay about a jazz musician set in the 1930s . Allen said later that the United Artists executives were `` stunned ... because they had expected a comedy . ( They ) were very worried and told me , ' We realize that we signed a contract with you and you can do anything you want . But we want to tell you that we really do n't like this . ' '' Allen went along with United Artists , writing and directing Bananas instead . In 1995 , he dismissed The Jazz Baby as having been `` probably too ambitious . '' \n The film was the first of Allen 's that was edited by Alisa Lepselter , who has edited all of Allen 's films since . Lepselter succeeded Susan E. Morse , who edited Allen 's films for the previous twenty years . \n Sweet and Lowdown is a 1999 American comedy - drama film written and directed by Woody Allen . Loosely based on Federico Fellini 's film La Strada , the film tells the fictional story , set in the 1930s , of a self - confident jazz guitarist Emmet Ray ( played by Sean Penn ) who falls in love with a mute woman ( Samantha Morton ) . The film also stars Uma Thurman and Anthony LaPaglia . Like several of Allen 's other films ( e.g. , Zelig ) , the film is occasionally interrupted by interviews with critics and biographers like Allen , Nat Hentoff , and Douglas McGrath , who comment on the film 's plot as if the characters were real - life people . \n The music for the film was arranged and conducted by Dick Hyman . All of the guitar solos are played by guitarist Howard Alden . Alden also coached Sean Penn on playing the guitar for his role in the film . \n In an October 26 , 2009 , appearance on Howard Stern 's radio program , Rosie O'Donnell claimed that Allen offered her the role of Hattie , despite the fact that she had been vocal in her disgust over Allen 's relationship with Soon - Yi Previn . When Stern asked if she were at all tempted to take the role despite her personal feelings , she replied that she was `` not for one minute tempted . '' The role went to Samantha Morton . \n Emmet Ray ( Sean Penn ) is a jazz guitarist who achieved some acclaim in the 1930s with a handful of recordings for RCA Victor , but who faded from public view under mysterious circumstances . Though a talented musician , Ray 's personal life is a shambles . He is a spendthrift , womanizer and pimp who believes that falling in love will ruin his musical career . Due to his heavy drinking , he 's often late or even absent for performances with his quintet . After music , his favorite hobby is shooting rats at garbage dumps . Ray idolizes famed guitarist Django Reinhardt , and is said to have fainted in his presence and to have fled a nightclub performance with severe stage fright upon hearing a false rumor that Reinhardt was in the audience . \n Additional rhythm guitarists : Bucky Pizzarelli and James Chirillo -- Chirillo played rhythm guitar on the Sweet Georgia Brown track -- where the crescent moon cable breaks while Sean Penn is riding it . Pizzarelli did all other rhythm tracks . \n Sweet and Lowdown was filmed entirely in New York and New Jersey but set in the Chicago area and California . \n When Blanche cheats with mobster Al Torrio ( Anthony LaPaglia ) , Ray leaves her and locates Hattie . He assumes that she will take him back , but discovers that she is happily married and raising a family . Afterwards , on a date with a new woman , a despondent Ray plays a melody that Hattie adored and then smashes his guitar and forlornly repeats the phrase `` I made a mistake ! '' He angrily smashes his guitar to pieces as his date leaves him . Woody Allen and the rest of the documentary experts remarked that Ray 's final compositions were legendary , finally reaching the quality of Reinhardt 's . \n On a double date with his drummer , Ray meets Hattie , a shy , mute laundress . After overcoming some initial frustration due to the difficulties of communication , Ray and Hattie form an affectionate and close relationship . She accompanies him on a cross-country trip to Hollywood , where he plays in a short film ; Hattie is spotted by a director and enjoys a brief screen career . However Ray is convinced that a musician of his stature should never settle down with one woman . On a whim , Ray marries socialite Blanche Williams ( Uma Thurman ) . However , Blanche sees Ray mainly as a colorful example of lower - class life and a source of inspiration for her literary writings . She reports that Ray is tormented by nightmares and shouts out Hattie 's name in his sleep .",

    "context": "Although it is one of the most famous quotes from the work of Shakespeare , no printing in Shakespeare 's lifetime presents the text in the form known to modern readers : it is a skillful amalgam assembled by Edmond Malone , an editor in the eighteenth century . \n ' Tis but thy name that is my enemy ; Thou art thyself , though not a Montague . What 's Montague ? It is nor hand , nor foot , Nor arm , nor face , nor any other part Belonging to a man . O , be some other name ! What 's in a name ? That which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet ; So Romeo would , were he not Romeo call 'd , Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title . Romeo , doff thy name , And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself . \n Q2 , a superior 1599 printing , is believed to be a more official version printed from Shakespeare 's original manuscript although perhaps not with Shakespeare 's personal input . This is believed since there are textual oddities such as `` false starts '' for speeches that were presumably not clearly crossed out enough for the printer to spot . \n ( Aside ) Shall I hear more , or shall I speak at this ? \n I take thee at thy word : Call me but love , and I 'll be new baptized ; Henceforth I never will be Romeo . \n ' Tis but thy name that is my enemy : Thou art thyself , though not a Montague , What 's Montague ? It is not hand nor foot , Nor arm nor face . O be some other name , belonging to a man ! What 's in a name ? That which we call a rose , By any other word would smell as sweet . \n In Act II , Scene II of the play , the line is said by Juliet in reference to Romeo 's house , Montague which would imply that his name means nothing and they should be together . \n ' Tis but thy name that is mine enemy : What 's Montague ? It is not hand nor foot , Nor arm , nor face , nor any other part . What 's in a name ? That which we call a rose , By any other name would smell as sweet . \n O Romeo , Romeo ! wherefore art thou Romeo ? Deny thy father and refuse thy name ; Or , if thou wilt not , be but sworn my love , And I 'll no longer be a Capulet \n `` A rose by any other name would smell as sweet '' is a popular reference to William Shakespeare 's play Romeo and Juliet , in which Juliet seems to argue that it does not matter that Romeo is from her family 's rival house of Montague , that is , that he is named `` Montague '' . The reference is often used to imply that the names of things do not affect what they really are . This formulation is , however , a paraphrase of Shakespeare 's actual language . Juliet compares Romeo to a rose saying that if he were not named Romeo he would still be handsome and be Juliet 's love . This states that if he were not Romeo , then he would not be a Montague and she would be able to get married with no problem at all . \n Malone reasoned that the awkward half - line of ' belonging to a man ' could be reconnected into verse through correction with Q1 . Modern editors have generally concurred . \n Romeo and Juliet was published twice , in two very different versions . The first version of 1597 , named `` Q1 '' , is believed to have been an unauthorised pirate copy or bad quarto provided to the printer by actors off the books : a memorial reconstruction . It may also , separately , represent a version of the play improved and trimmed after rehearsals for more dramatic impact .",

    "context": "At the time , Kraepelin was doing clinical research on psychosis in senile patients ; Alzheimer , on the other hand , was more interested in the lab work of senile illnesses . The two men would face many challenges involving the politics of the psychiatric community . For example , both formal and informal arrangements would be made among psychiatrists at asylums and universities to receive cadavers . In 1908 he was a professor at the Ludwig Maximilian University and the Neurological and Psychiatric Clinic of the Friedrich - Wilhelm University from 1912 until he fell ill . \n Aloysius Alzheimer was born in Marktbreit , Bavaria on 14 June 1864 . His father served in the office of notary public in the family 's hometown . \n On 8 April 1906 , Frau Deter died , and Alzheimer had her medical records and brain brought to Munich where he was working in Kraepelin 's laboratory . With two Italian physicians , he used the staining techniques of Bielschowsky to identify amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles . These brain anomalies would become identifiers of what later became known as Alzheimer 's disease . \n The two men had different interpretations of the disease , but due to Alzheimer 's short life , they never had the opportunity to meet and discuss their ideas . \n In 1901 , Alzheimer observed a patient at the Frankfurt Asylum named Auguste Deter . The 51 - year - old patient had strange behavioral symptoms , including a loss of short - term memory ; she became his obsession over the coming years . Auguste Deter was a victim of the politics of the time in the psychiatric community ; the Frankfurt asylum was too expensive for her husband . Herr Deter made several requests to have his wife moved to a less expensive facility , but Alzheimer intervened in these requests . Ms. Deter remained at the Frankfurt asylum , where Alzheimer had made a deal to receive her records and brain upon her death . \n In the early 1990s , critics began to question Alzheimer 's findings and form their own hypotheses based on Alzheimer 's notes and papers . Amaducci and colleagues hypothesized that Auguste Deter had metachromatic leukodystrophy , a rare condition in which accumulations of fats affect the cells that produce myelin . \n Following the lecture , Alzheimer published a short paper summarizing his lecture ; in 1907 he wrote a larger paper detailing the disease and his findings . The disease would not become known as Alzheimer 's disease until 1910 , when Kraepelin named it so in the chapter on `` Presenile and Senile Dementia '' in the 8th edition of his Handbook of Psychiatry . By 1911 , his description of the disease was being used by European physicians to diagnose patients in the US . \n Alzheimer was known for having a variety of medical interests including vascular diseases of the brain , early dementia , brain tumors , forensic psychiatry and epilepsy . Alzheimer was a leading specialist in histopathology in Europe . His colleagues knew him to be a dedicated professor and cigar smoker . \n The following year , he spent five months assisting mentally ill women before he took an office in the city mental asylum in Frankfurt am Main , the Städtische Anstalt für Irre und Epileptische ( Asylum for Lunatics and Epileptics ) . Emil Sioli , a noted psychiatrist , was the dean of the asylum . Another neurologist , Franz Nissl , began to work in the same asylum with Alzheimer . Together , they conducted research on the pathology of the nervous system , specifically the normal and pathological anatomy of the cerebral cortex . Alzheimer was the co-founder and co-publisher of the journal Zeitschrift für die gesamte Neurologie und Psychiatrie , though he never wrote a book that he could call his own . \n In April 1884 , he married Cecille Simonette Nathalie Geisenheimer , with whom he had three children . Cecille died in 1901 . In 1887 , Alois Alzheimer graduated from Würzburg with a degree in medicine . \n In August 1912 , Alzheimer fell ill on the train on his way to the University of Breslau , where he had been appointed professor of psychiatry in July 1912 . Most probably he had a streptococcal infection and subsequent rheumatic fever leading to valvular heart disease , heart failure and kidney failure . He never recovered completely from this illness . \n Aloysius Alzheimer ( / ˈɑːltshaɪmər , ˈælts - , ˈɔːlts - / ; German : ( ˈaːloˌis ˈalts. haɪmɐ ) ; 14 June 1864 -- 19 December 1915 ) , known as Alois Alzheimer , was a German psychiatrist and neuropathologist and a colleague of Emil Kraepelin . Alzheimer is credited with identifying the first published case of `` presenile dementia '' , which Kraepelin would later identify as Alzheimer 's disease . \n The Alzheimers moved when Alois was still young in order to give their children an opportunity to attend the Royal Humanistic Gymnasium . Later , Alois studied medicine at Aschaffenburg and at the universities of Tübingen , Berlin , and Würzburg . In his final year of school he was on the fencing team and a member of a fraternity , and even received a fine for disturbing the peace while out with his team . \n Another hypothesis offered by Claire O'Brien was that Auguste Deter actually had a vascular dementing disease . Through extremely fortunate circumstances the original microscope preparations on which Alzheimer based his description of the disease were rediscovered in 1998 in Munich , and his findings could thus be reevaluated . The slides confirmed that Auguste Deter did in fact have what is now known as Alzheimer 's disease . \n He died of heart failure on 19 December 1915 , aged 51 , in Breslau , Silesia ( present - day Wrocław , Poland ) . He was buried on 23 December 1915 next to his wife in the Hauptfriedhof in Frankfurt am Main . \n Alzheimer discussed his findings on the brain pathology and symptoms of presenile dementia publicly on 3 November 1906 , at the Tübingen meeting of the Southwest German Psychiatrists . The attendees at this lecture seemed uninterested in what he had to say . The lecturer that followed Alzheimer was to speak on the topic of `` compulsive masturbation '' , which the audience was so eagerly awaiting that they sent Alzheimer away without any questions or comments on his discovery of the pathology of a type of senile dementia . \n While at the Frankfurt asylum , Alzheimer also met Emil Kraepelin , one of the best - known German psychiatrists of the time . Kraepelin became a mentor to Alzheimer , and the two worked very closely for the next several years . When Kraepelin moved to Munich to work at the Royal Psychiatric Hospital in 1903 , he invited Alzheimer to join him . \n American Solomon Carter Fuller gave a report similar to that of Alzheimer at a lecture five months before Alzheimer . Oskar Fischer was a fellow German psychiatrist , 12 years Alzheimer 's junior , who reported 12 cases of senile dementia in 1907 around the time that Alzheimer published his short paper summarizing his lecture .",

    "context": "Scary Movie 2 is a 2001 American horror comedy film and the second film in the Scary Movie franchise . The film stars Anna Faris , Regina Hall , Shawn Wayans , and Marlon Wayans ( all reprising their roles from the first film , despite their characters having been killed off ) , as well as Tim Curry , Tori Spelling , Chris Elliott , Chris Masterson , Kathleen Robertson , David Cross , and James Woods . \n The film is a sequel to Scary Movie . According to director Keenen Ivory Wayans , the makers of the film watched over 130 horror films for background research . Marlon Brando was originally cast as Father McFeely and completed one day of filming before he had to leave the production due to illness . He was replaced by James Woods who was paid $1 million for four days work . Charlton Heston has also turned down the James Woods part . At one point , former President Bill Clinton , who had just left office the year the film came out ( 2001 ) , was considered for the James Woods part . Because Miramax had not greenlit this sequel until the massive box office success of the original , the film faced a punishing production schedule that involved coming up with a script and tearing through production and post-production in a total of less than 9 months , roughly half the average time for all those steps to be completed on a standard Hollywood production in 2000 - 2001 . \n Scary Movie 2 received generally negative reviews from critics . On Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 15 % based on 109 reviews with an average rating of 3.4 / 10 The site 's critical consensus reads , `` Instead of being funny , this gross - out sequel plays like a sloppy , rushed - out product . '' On Metacritic , the film has a score of 29 out of 100 based on 25 critics , indicating `` generally unfavorable reviews '' . Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of `` B '' on an A+ to F scale . \n Professor Oldman is seduced and killed by the ghost of Hugh 's mistress . Shorty later encounters the same ghost , but seduces and has sex with her . After Dwight equips the teens with weapons that can injure their spectral enemy , they are pursued throughout the mansion . Buddy and Cindy get locked in the walk - in freezer . Cindy gives Buddy a handjob and `` revives '' him , resulting in him releasing semen blasting Cindy to the door . Cindy then uses a collection of random objects in the room to produce a Caterpillar tractor and escapes the freezer . \n Professor Oldman ( Tim Curry ) and his charming paraplegic assistant , Dwight Hartman ( David Cross ) , plan to study the paranormal activity at a local haunted mansion called Hell House . They use Cindy and her friends as test subjects . At the mansion , Cindy encounters a foul - mouthed parrot and Hanson ( Chris Elliott ) , the caretaker with a badly malformed hand . Later , the group is joined by newcomer Theo ( Kathleen Robertson ) . They sit down for dinner , but soon lose their appetite due to Hanson 's repulsive antics . \n A teenage girl named Megan Voorhees ( Natasha Lyonne ) becomes possessed by the spirit of Hugh Kane ( Richard Moll ) , the house 's previous owner . During a formal dinner party she emerges in her pajamas , insults her mother and the guests , then proceeds to urinate profusely on the floor . In response , Megan 's mother ( Veronica Cartwright ) seeks help from two priests , Father McFeely ( James Woods ) and Father Harris ( Andy Richter ) . After paying a trip to the bathroom , the men attempt to drive Hugh 's ghost out , but the exorcism does not go as planned . After a chain of projectile vomits and various instances of pedophilia , Megan insults Father McFeely 's mother . He responds by pulling out a gun and shooting Megan . \n Two months later , Cindy and Buddy are in a relationship . They are out on a walk when Buddy disappears and Hanson shows up . As he closes in menacingly , he gets hit by a car . The car 's driver is Shorty , who is receiving a blowjob from the ghost that he seduced earlier . \n In North America , the film grossed $ 71,308,997 . Worldwide , it grossed $141,220,678 . Although it was a hit , out of the first four Scary Movie films , this was the least successful to date -- until the fifth film was released twelve years later . \n The film is the last in the series to feature the involvement of stars Marlon and Shawn Wayans , and director Keenen Ivory Wayans . However , the Wayans would eventually go on to produce a similar horror - themed parody , A Haunted House , and its sequel , both starring Marlon Wayans . \n Hanson gets possessed by Kane and kidnaps Shorty , who is high on drugs . In the dining room , Hanson sets up a cooker and cuts off the top of Shorty 's head . Instead of a brain , there is a small man rapping ( Beetlejuice ) inside . Cindy , Brenda , and Theo team up to fight Hanson , but wind up defeated . Dwight regroups with the teens . Cindy acts as bait to lure Kane into a device that will destroy him . The plan succeeds , freeing the group from the house 's curse . \n Where the original film was mainly based on the slasher films of the ' 90s , Scary Movie 2 parodies an array of supernatural and haunted house films from various decades , including The Haunting ( 1999 ) , The Exorcist ( 1973 ) , The Amityville Horror ( 1979 ) , Poltergeist ( 1982 ) , The Legend of Hell House ( 1973 ) , House on Haunted Hill ( both the 1959 and 1999 versions ) , and The Changeling ( 1980 ) . It also spoofs some contemporary films , such as Hannibal ( 2001 ) , and Hollow Man ( 2000 ) . \n The film premiered on DVD on December 18 , 2001 . It was later released on Blu - ray a decade later on September 20 , 2011 , after Lionsgate purchased Miramax and Dimension Films 's catalogues . \n Despite generally negative reviews from critics , Scary Movie 2 was a box office success , grossing $141.2 million worldwide from a $45 million budget . \n Meanwhile , Cindy Campbell ( Anna Faris ) , Brenda Meeks ( Regina Hall ) , Ray Wilkins ( Shawn Wayans ) , and Shorty Meeks ( Marlon Wayans ) are at college , trying to live new lives since the events of the first film . Cindy and Brenda get tagged by a socially maladjusted girl , Alex ( Tori Spelling ) . Shorty is still the same stoner he was before . Ray , still confused about his sexuality , has two new male friends , Tommy ( James DeBello ) and Buddy ( Christopher Masterson ) . Buddy becomes romantically interested in Cindy , but she rebuffs him . \n Later that night , Cindy hears voices directing her to a secret room , where she and Buddy discover the diary of Hugh Kane 's wife . Seeing her portrait , they note Cindy 's resemblance to her . Meanwhile , other teens also experience bizarre encounters . Hugh Kane 's ghost has sex with Alex in her bedroom , but retreats when Alex expresses her interest in becoming the new Mrs. Kane . Cindy gets involved in a fistfight with the house cat , Mr. Kittles . A toy clown ( Suli McCullough ) attempts to kill Ray , but in a strange turn of events , the clown doll gets raped by Ray instead . A weed - monster rolls Shorty into a joint .

    "answers": "",
    "context": "The Iranian plateau in geology refers to a geographical area north of the great folded mountain belts resulting from the collision of the Arabian plate with the Eurasian plate . In this definition , the Iranian plateau does not cover southwestern Iran . It extends from East Azerbaijan Province in northwest of Iran ( Persia ) all the way to Pakistan west of the Indus River . It also includes smaller parts of the Republic of Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan . \n In the Bronze Age , Elam stretched across the Zagros mountains , connecting Mesopotamia and the Iranian Plateau . The kingdoms of Aratta known from cuneiform sources may have been located in the Central Iranian Plateau . \n The Middle Persian Erān ( whence Modern Persian Irān ) began to be used in reference to the state ( rather than as an ethnic designator ) from the Sassanid period ( see Etymology of Iran ) . \n The plateau also produces wheat , barley , millet , beans , opium , cotton , lucerne , and tobacco . The barley is fed mainly to horses . Sesame is grown and made into sesame oil . Mushrooms and manna were also seen in the plateau area as of 1920 . Caraway is grown in the Kerman Province . \n As a historical region , it includes Parthia , Media , Persis , the heartlands of Iran and some of its recently lost territories . The Zagros Mountains form the plateau 's western boundary , and its eastern slopes may be included in the term . The Encyclopædia Britannica excludes `` lowland Khuzestan '' explicitly and characterizes Elam as spanning `` the region from the Mesopotamian plain to the Iranian Plateau '' . \n Archaeological sites and cultures of the Iranian plateau include : \n In geology , the plateau region of Iran primarily formed of the accretionary Gondwanan terranes between the Turan platform to the north and the Main Zagros Thrust , the suture zone between the northward moving Arabian plate and the Eurasian continent , is called the Iranian plateau . It is a geologically well - studied area because of general interest in continental collision zones , and because of Iran 's long history of research in geology , particularly in economic geology ( although Iran 's major petroleum reserves are not in the plateau ) . \n From the Caspian in the northwest to Baluchistan in the south - east , the Iranian Plateau extends for close to 2,000 km . It encompasses the greater part of Iran , Afghanistan and Pakistan west of the Indus River on an area roughly outlined by the quadrangle formed by the cities of Tabriz , Shiraz , Peshawar and Quetta containing some 3,700,000 square kilometres ( 1,400,000 sq mi ) . In spite of being called a `` plateau '' , it is far from flat but contains several mountain ranges , the highest peak being Damavand in the Alborz at 5610 m , and the Dasht - e Loot east of Kerman in Central Iran falling below 300 m . \n Southeast Anatolia lies south of the Anti-Taurus Mountains . It is a region of rolling hills and a broad plateau surface that extends into Syria . Elevations decrease gradually , from about 800 meters ( 2,600 ft ) in the north to about 500 meters ( 1,600 ft ) in the south . Traditionally , wheat and barley are the main crops of the region . \n The Northwestern Iranian Plateau , where the Pontic and Taurus Mountains converge , is rugged country with higher elevations , a more severe climate , and greater precipitation than are found on the Anatolian Plateau . The region is known as the Anti-Taurus , and the average elevation of its peaks exceeds 3,000 m . Mount Ararat , at 5,137 meters ( 16,854 ft ) the highest point in Turkey , is located in the Anti-Taurus . Lake Van is situated in the mountains at an elevation of 1,546 meters ( 5,072 ft ) . \n The plateau is abundant with wildlife including leopards , bears , hyenas , wild boars , ibex , gazelles , and mouflons . These animals are mostly found in the wooded mountains of the plateau . The shores of the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf house aquatic birds such as seagulls , ducks , and geese . Deer , hedgehogs , foxes , and 22 species of rodents are found in semidesert , and palm squirrels and Asiatic black bears live in Baluchistan . \n The Iranian plateau harvests trees for making doors , ploughs , and baskets . Fruit is grown also . Pears , apples , apricots , quince , plums , nectarines , cherries , mulberries , and peaches were commonly seen in the 20th century . Almonds and pistachios are common in warmer areas . Dates , oranges , grapes , melon , and limes are also grown . Other edibles include potatoes and cauliflower , which were hard to grow until European settlement brought irrigation improvements . Other vegetables include cabbage , tomatoes , artichokes , cucumbers , spinach , radishes , lettuce , and eggplants . \n The plateau has historical oak and poplar forests . Oak forests are found around Shiraz . Aspen , elm , ash , willow , walnut , pine , and cypress are also found , though the latter two are rare . As of 1920 , poplar was harvested for making doors . Elm was used for ploughs . Other trees like acacia , cypress , and Turkestan elm were used for decorative purposes . Flower wise , the plateau can grow lilac , jasmine , and roses . Hawthorn and Cercis siliquastrum are common , which are both used for basket weaving . \n Wide variety of amphibians and reptiles such as toads , frogs , tortoises , lizards , salamanders , racers , rat snakes ( Ptyas ) , cat snakes ( Tarbophis fallax ) , and vipers live the Baluchistan region and along the slopes of the Elburz and Zagros mountains . 200 varieties of fish live in the Persian Gulf . 30 species of the most important commercial fish Sturgeon is found in the Caspian Sea . \n The Persian Plateau , or Iranian Plateau , is a geological formation in Western Asia and Central Asia . It is the part of the Eurasian Plate wedged between the Arabian and Indian plates , situated between the Zagros Mountains to the west , the Caspian Sea and the Kopet Dag to the north , the Armenian Highlands and the Caucasus Mountains in the northwest , the Strait of Hormuz and Persian Gulf to the south and the Indus River to the east in Pakistan . \n Its mountain ranges can be divided into five major sub-regions ( see below ) . \n In classical antquity the region was known as Persia , due to the Persian Achaemenid dynasty , originating in Persia proper , or Fars . \n The headwaters of major rivers arise in the Anti-Taurus : the east - flowing Aras River , which empties into the Caspian Sea ; the south - flowing Euphrates and Tigris join in Iraq before emptying into the Persian Gulf . Several small streams that empty into the Black Sea or landlocked Lake Van also originate in these mountains . The Indus River begins in the highlands of Tibet and flows the length of Pakistan almost tracing the eastern edge of the Iranian plateau . The Indus River forms the Iranian plateau 's eastern boundary .",

    "context": "Michigan 's Lower Peninsula can be divided into four main regions based on geological , soil , and vegetation differences ; amount of urban areas or rural areas ; minority populations ; and agriculture . The four principal regions listed below can further be separated into sub-regions and overlapping areas . \n The Lower Peninsula of Michigan is the southern of the two major landmasses of the U.S. state of Michigan , the other being the Upper Peninsula . It is surrounded by water on all sides except its southern border , which it shares with Indiana and Ohio . Although the Upper Peninsula is commonly referred to as `` the U.P. '' it is fairly uncommon for the Lower Peninsula to be called `` the L.P. '' \n Coordinates : 43 ° 40 ′ N 84 ° 44 ′ W ﻿ / ﻿ 43.66 ° N 84.73 ° W ﻿ / 43.66 ; - 84.73 \n The Great Lakes Circle Tour is a designated scenic road system connecting all of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River . \n Primary Interstate Highways have two digits on their shields ; auxiliary Interstate Highways have three digits . Interstate Highways include : \n The Lower Peninsula dominates Michigan politics , and maps of it without the Upper Peninsula are sometimes presented as `` Michigan '' , which contribute to resentment by `` Yoopers '' ( residents of `` the U.P '' ) . Yoopers jokingly refer to residents of the Lower Peninsula as `` flat - landers '' ( referring to the region 's less rugged terrain ) or `` trolls '' ( because , living south of the Mackinac Bridge , they `` live under the bridge '' ) . \n The Lower Peninsula is dominated by a geological basin known as the Michigan Basin . That feature is represented by a nearly circular pattern of geologic sedimentary strata in the area with a nearly uniform structural dip toward the center of the peninsula . The basin is centered in Gladwin County where the Precambrian basement rocks are 16,000 feet ( 4,900 m ) deep . Around the margins , such as under Mackinaw City , Michigan , the Precambrian surface is around 4,000 feet ( 1,200 m ) down . This 4,000 - foot ( 1,200 m ) contour on the bedrock clips the northern part of the lower peninsula and continues under Lake Michigan along the west . It crosses the southern counties of Michigan and continues on to the north beneath Lake Huron . \n Because of its recognizable shape , the Lower Peninsula is nicknamed `` the mitten '' , with the eastern region identified as `` The Thumb '' . This has led to several folkloric creation myths for the area , one being that it is a hand print of Paul Bunyan , a giant lumberjack and popular European - American folk character in Michigan . When asked where they live , Lower Peninsula residents may hold up their right palm and point to a spot on it to indicate the location . The peninsula is sometimes divided into the Northern Lower Peninsula -- which is more sparsely populated and largely forested -- and the Southern Lower Peninsula -- which is largely urban or farmland . \n At its widest points , the Lower Peninsula is 277 miles ( 446 km ) long from north to south and 195 miles ( 314 km ) from east to west . It contains nearly two - thirds of Michigan 's total land area . The surface of the peninsula is generally level , broken by conical hills and glacial moraines usually not more than a few hundred feet tall . The western coast features extensive sandy beaches and dunes . It is divided by a low water divide running north and south . The larger portion of the state is on the west of this and gradually slopes toward Lake Michigan . The highest point in the Lower Peninsula is not definitely established but is either Briar Hill at 1,705 feet ( 520 m ) , or one of several points nearby in the vicinity of Cadillac . The lowest point is the surface of Lake Erie at 571 feet ( 174 m ) . \n The Lower Peninsula is bounded on the south by the states of Indiana and Ohio . It is bounded by the west by Lake Michigan and on the northeast by Lake Huron , which connect at the Straits of Mackinac . In the southeast , the waterway of the St. Clair River , Lake St. Clair , Detroit River , and Lake Erie separate it from the province of Ontario , Canada . \n The American Bird Conservancy and the National Audubon Society have designated several locations as internationally Important Bird Areas .",

When Monica comes back out of her room to begin getting ready for the wedding , Rachel distracts her by saying `` I 'm never gon na get married '' and started to cry . \n The first part has a 9.1 rating at TV.com with the second having a slightly higher 9.3 . Gary Oldman received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his portrayal of Richard Crosby. ( 1 ) \n At the studios , Joey is stuck shooting an easy scene over and over since Richard is drunk and can barely stay focused . The director makes it very clear to Joey that he ca n't leave until the scene is finished or as long as Richard is on set and conscious , so Joey convinces a confused Richard that they 've completed all of their scenes and sends him home . \n The show was filmed over two weeks , with all of the scenes featuring Gary Oldman being filmed in the first week . The wedding was filmed in the second week , with the final shot of Rachel filmed after the studio audience had left . \n Meanwhile , Ross and Phoebe find a confused Chandler in his office . He tells them he loves Monica so much , and he does n't want to hurt her , but he 's afraid that becoming ' the Bings ' will spell marital misery , maybe as bad as his parents . Ross convinces Chandler to go back to the apartment and begin getting ready , doing one thing at a time , not thinking about the goal . In Monica 's apartment , Rachel tries other less believable tactics to distract Monica and she realizes that something is going on . Rachel decides to tell Monica , and starts saying `` We ca n't find Chandler ... '' . At this point , Phoebe opens the door and gives a thumbs - up sign to Rachel , who suddenly changes the subject `` Chandler ... 's vest '' , controlling the situation . \n When they return to their apartments , Rachel , Phoebe and Monica are sitting down at the table in Monica 's apartment . Monica gets up , walks to her wedding dress and asks Rachel and Phoebe if anyone wanted to be in charge of looking after the dress . Rachel volunteers , but Monica ignores her since she obviously thinks Rachel is irresponsible from results in the past . Rachel is hurt when she volunteers twice and Monica does n't give her the responsibility . She states that she can be responsible , leading Monica to feel as if she 's misjudging her . She apologizes to Rachel and hands over the responsibility to her . \n After the dinner , when Ross goes to Joey 's apartment looking for Chandler ( who 's staying there that night because of the whole `` the groom is n't supposed to see the bride before the wedding '' thing ) , he finds an empty apartment and a note . When he unfolds it , he finds a note from Chandler saying `` tell Monica I 'm sorry '' . Ross immediately goes across the hall to Monica 's apartment - Rachel opens the door when Monica is in her bedroom , and Ross explains the situation to her . A little while later , Phoebe arrives at the door to find out what 's going on and when Rachel just hands over the note without explaining the situation , Phoebe assumes Ross wrote it and tells him to tell Monica himself that he 's sorry . Ross goes out to search for Chandler but unfortunately fails . \n At the hotel , everything is ready for the wedding when Joey calls Rachel to warn her that he 'll be late . Meanwhile , Ross is keeping an eye on Chandler since he still has cold feet . Chandler steps out to sneak a cigarette when he suddenly hears Phoebe and Rachel coming , so he ducks into a storeroom to hide . He overhears that Monica 's pregnant and takes off again . Rachel finds another wedding finishing up in the same hotel and convinces the minister to officiate the wedding in case Joey does n't arrive in time . Meanwhile , Ross and Phoebe find Chandler again , who admits that he was indeed running away until he found a small baby outfit in the hotel 's gift store and realized that someone that small ca n't be scary . He then goes with Phoebe and Ross to the wedding . \n Back at Monica 's apartment , Chandler and Monica are going to their wedding rehearsal . Chandler listens to the answering machine after Monica leaves , when he realizes they 're becoming `` The Bings '' . At the rehearsal things are going smoothly until Chandler 's parents come and things go crazy . When Chandler 's mom , Nora Tyler - Bing ( played by Morgan Fairchild ) , is introduced to Monica 's parents Jack and Judy Geller , Jack embarrasses himself by asking her `` so ... are you Chandler 's mom or dad ? '' Chandler 's mom and Chandler 's dad , Charles Bing ( played by Kathleen Turner ) , keep having arguments . As a consequence , Rachel is told by Monica to keep them away from each other . Since Rachel does n't know what Chandler 's dad looks like , Monica describes him , saying `` a man in the black dress '' . When Rachel looks around , she spots a woman in a black dress having a drink nearby , and assumes that she is Chandler 's dad . When both of them introduce themselves , the woman says her name is Amanda and Rachel replies `` Oh , I get it - a-man - duh ! '' , embarrassing herself . \n `` The One with Monica and Chandler 's Wedding '' is a double length episode of the television sitcom Friends . It first aired on May 17 , 2001 as the finale of season seven . It is usually broadcast in a one - hour slot and presented on DVD as one complete episode , but when the episodes are split the two parts are differentiated by the suffixes Part 1 and Part 2 . For his guest appearance , Gary Oldman was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series . \n At the studios , Joey has started shooting with Richard Crosby ( Gary Oldman ) who keeps spitting while saying his lines which annoys Joey . When he ca n't stand it anymore , he talks to Richard about it , when Richard tells him that all good actors spit while saying their lines . Therefore , when they shoot the next scene , Joey and Richard both constantly spit at each other while saying their lines . When their scenes are over for the day , Joey is given lines for scenes for the next day . However , Joey ca n't come the next day since he is performing Monica and Chandler 's wedding . Because he 's still in the mood of saying the lines , he accidentally spits on the man who gave him the lines , while telling him that he has important plans due to which he ca n't come . \n Monica is making a list of things which are most likely to go wrong which seems to be all Rachel 's chores when suddenly Joey appears telling them that he got a part in the movie which he wanted , which is related to World War I . \n As the ceremony begins , Joey finally arrives and takes his place between Monica and Chandler , accidentally letting slip that Chandler had second thoughts about the wedding . Monica delivers her self - written vow , while Chandler delivers one from the heart - both speeches are very moving . When the ceremony is over Chandler tells Monica that he knows about her being pregnant and how Phoebe told him she found a pregnancy test in the trash , but she reveals she did n't take a pregnancy test . Phoebe exclaims to Rachel how Chandler & Monica are now married and how great it is that they 're going to have a baby , and the camera zooms in on Rachel as she manages out a weak `` uh - huh '' with a slightly panicked look on her face , thus revealing to the audience that she 's the one who 's pregnant . \n The next morning , Ross arrives at Monica 's apartment and informs Rachel and Phoebe that he still has n't found Chandler . When he leaves , Monica comes out of her room in excitement and starts getting ready . Seeing that Chandler still is n't found and Monica 's so excited and thrilled about her wedding day , Rachel starts to panic and eventually cries . Therefore , Phoebe takes her to the bathroom because Monica ca n't see her in this state or she will know something 's wrong . When they 're in there , Phoebe finds a positive pregnancy test in the garbage and deduces that Monica is pregnant .",

These T cells bind to the MHC II - antigen molecule and cause activation of the B cell . This is a type of safeguard to the system , almost like a two - factor authentication method . First , the B cells have to encounter a foreign antigen , and are then required to be activated by T helper cells before they differentiate to specific cells . \n The most immature blood cell that is considered of plasma cell lineage is the plasmablast . Plasmablasts secrete more antibodies than B cells , but less than plasma cells . They divide rapidly and are still capable of internalizing antigens and presenting them to T cells . A cell may stay in this state for several days , and then either die or irrevocably differentiate into a mature , fully differentiated plasma cell . Differentiation of mature B cells into plasma cells is dependent upon the transcription factors Blimp - 1 / PRDM1 and IRF4 . \n Plasma cells can only produce a single kind of antibody in a single class of immunoglobulin . In other words , every B cell is specific to a single antigen , but each cell can produce several thousand matching antibodies per second . This prolific production of antibodies is an integral part of the humoral immune response . \n Primary amyloidosis ( AL ) is caused by the deposition of excess immunoglobulin light chains which are secreted from plasma cells . \n Upon stimulation by a T cell , which usually occurs in germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs like the spleen and lymph nodes , the activated B cell begins to differentiate into more specialized cells . Germinal center B cells may differentiate into memory B cells or plasma cells . Most of these B cells will become plasmablasts ( or `` immature plasma cells '' ) , and eventually plasma cells , and begin producing large volumes of antibodies . Some B cells will undergo a process known as affinity maturation . This process favors , by selection for the ability to bind antigen with higher affinity , the activation and growth of B cell clones able to secrete antibodies of higher affinity for the antigen . \n The surface antigen CD138 ( syndecan - 1 ) is expressed at high levels . \n After the process of affinity maturation in germinal centers , plasma cells have an indeterminate lifespan , ranging from days to months . Recently they have been shown to reside for much longer periods in the bone marrow as long - lived plasma cells ( LLPC ) . They secrete high levels of antibodies , ranging from hundreds to thousands of antibodies per second per cell . Unlike their precursors , they can not switch antibody classes , can not act as antigen - presenting cells because they no longer display MHC - II , and do not take up antigen because they no longer display significant quantities of immunoglobulin on the cell surface . However , continued exposure to antigen through those low levels of immunoglobulin is important , as it partly determines the cell 's lifespan . \n Common variable immunodeficiency is thought to be due to a problem in the differentiation from lymphocytes to plasma cells . The result is a low serum antibody level and risk of infections . \n Plasma cells , also called plasma B cells , plasmocytes , plasmacytes , or effector B cells , are white blood cells that secrete large volumes of antibodies . They are transported by the blood plasma and the lymphatic system . Plasma cells originate in the bone marrow ; B cells differentiate into plasma cells that produce antibody molecules closely modelled after the receptors of the precursor B cell . Once released into the blood and lymph , these antibody molecules bind to the target antigen ( foreign substance ) and initiate its neutralization or destruction . \n Plasma cells are large lymphocytes with a considerable nucleus - to - cytoplasm ratio and a characteristic appearance on light microscopy . They have basophilic cytoplasm and an eccentric nucleus with heterochromatin in a characteristic cartwheel or clock face arrangement . Their cytoplasm also contains a pale zone that on electron microscopy contains an extensive Golgi apparatus and centrioles ( EM picture ) . Abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum combined with a well - developed Golgi apparatus makes plasma cells well - suited for secreting immunoglobulins . Other organelles in a plasma cell include ribosomes , lysosomes , mitochondria , and the plasma membrane . \n Plasmacytoma , multiple myeloma , Waldenström macroglobulinemia and plasma cell leukemia are malignant neoplasms ( `` cancer '' ) of the plasma cells . Multiple myeloma is frequently identified because malignant plasma cells continue producing an antibody , which can be detected as a paraprotein . \n The lifespan , class of antibodies produced , and the location that the plasma cell moves to also depends on signals , such as cytokines , received from the T cell during differentiation . Differentiation through a T cell - independent antigen stimulation ( stimulation of a B cell that does not require the involvement of a T cell ) can happen anywhere in the body and results in short - lived cells that secrete IgM antibodies . The T cell - dependent processes are subdivided into primary and secondary responses : a primary response ( meaning that the T cell is present at the time of initial contact by the B cell with the antigen ) produces short - lived cells that remain in the extramedullary regions of lymph nodes ; a secondary response produces longer - lived cells that produce IgG and IgA , and frequently travel to the bone marrow . For example , plasma cells will likely secrete IgG3 antibodies if they matured in the presence of the cytokine interferon - gamma . Since B cell maturation also involves somatic hypermutation ( a process completed before differentiation into a plasma cell ) , these antibodies frequently have a very high affinity for their antigen . \n Another important surface antigen is CD319 ( SLAMF7 ) . This antigen is expressed at high levels on normal human plasma cells . It is also expressed on malignant plasma cells in multiple myeloma . Compared with CD138 , which disappears rapidly ex vivo , the expression of CD319 is considerably more stable .",

    "context": "The character of Angela Montenegro is a specialist in forensic facial reconstruction at the fictional Jeffersonian Institution , who frequently works with Dr. Temperance Brennan , her best friend . Angela received her undergraduate degree at the University of Texas at Austin in Visual Arts , with a minor in Computer Science . She also studied Biomedical Illustration at American University . She uses her skills as an artist to develop , maintain , and improve the lab 's three - dimensional graphics and computer simulation systems . She is credited with the innovation of the `` Angelator '' , which is later recreated / replaced with a newer version , the `` Angelatron '' . She is the only member of the Medico - Legal Lab staff who does not hold an advanced degree . In `` The Brain in the Bot '' , in Season 12 , Angela wins the MacArthur Fellowship , which is confirmed later to be nominated by Dr. Temperance Brennan , for her `` groundbreaking '' work with the `` Angelatron '' . \n Angela Pearly - Gates Montenegro - Hodgins ( born Pookie Noodlin Pearly - Gates Gibbons ) is a fictional character in the television series Bones ( 2005 -- 2017 ) , portrayed by Michaela Conlin . She is a classically trained artist involved in forensic reconstructions . \n Throughout the series , Angela Montenegro is described as a `` free spirit '' , `` good - time girl '' and is a `` wild - child '' at heart . She is shown to be more socially `` normal '' than her coworkers at the Jeffersonian , and seems to not consider herself a scientist like the other `` squints '' , instead on multiple occasions referencing facial reconstruction as an `` art '' . In one episode , the character Jack Hodgins was quoted as saying Angela `` was the heart of the operation . '' Angela 's more typical social skills are often used by the writers as a balancing point ; she demonstrates a need to interact with other people in a way her more awkward colleagues do not . Plotlines have alluded that Angela has extensive romantic experience , once telling Zack Addy to `` reap the benefits of my sexual wisdom . '' She also told Dr. Brennan , `` I do n't know how to talk to crazy people unless I 'm dating them . '' \n Season 1 Episode 17 , `` The Skull in the Desert '' , reveals that , for `` three weeks out of the year , Angela has a boyfriend and a vacation . '' Angela 's first revealed steady boyfriend , Kirk , is a `` pseudo-famous photographer '' who lives in the desert of New Mexico . Their five - year relationship ends abruptly when Kirk goes off into the desert with his Indian guide and never returns . Angela is prompted to call Temperance for help when a skull is left on the porch of the local sheriff . Dr. Brennan is able to identify that the skull does belong to Kirk and the premise of the episode is discovering what happened to him out in the desert . According to Angela , he was the guy to whom she compared all other guys . \n Angela Montenegro is the daughter of a fictional representation of Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top ( played by the musician himself ) . Angela was born in Baltimore , Maryland on April 16 , she is half - Chinese , and she once mentioned having taken French in school , in `` The Body in the Bag '' , in season 6 . Her middle name is meant to be an allusion to her father 's guitar `` Miss Pearly Gates '' . According to Angela , in `` Mother and Child in the Bay '' , in season 2 , Angela 's height is 5'8 and her weight is 135 pounds . In Season 10 , Angela 's real name is discovered to be Pookie Noodlin . Prior to the revelation , it was well - known that she was so embarrassed by her birth name that she never told anyone , even her husband and closest friends . \n After breaking off her engagement with Hodgins , Angela resumes a relationship first forged in college with Roxie , a woman who currently works as a sculptor and who was , at the time of their reconnection , the suspect in a case . Roxie broke it off with Angela over irreconcilable differences in world view ; Angela `` lives in the moment '' and Roxie wants a partner who plans for the future . \n It is revealed that , at one point , she married in a kava - influenced ceremony in Fiji . She was unsure whether the marriage was legal and had no knowledge of where her husband was after the ritual ; in fact , the United States government considered the marriage valid , and prevented her marriage to Hodgins . When a private investigator tracked down Barasa , he attempted to convince Angela to stay with him , informing her that he had built them a house . Although she had no interest in pursuing anything with him , Barasa 's presence eventually precipitated the end of Angela 's engagement to Hodgins , because Angela felt that Hodgins did not trust her . \n Throughout seasons four and five , the two struggled with their relationship , eventually appearing to form a close , albeit awkward , friendship . After Hodgins declared he would support her during a pregnancy scare while she was dating Wendell Bray , their romantic tension was rekindled . While collecting evidence together for a murder investigation in Maryland , they were pulled over for a moving violation and subsequently jailed for a variety of minor infractions by a local sheriff . Their time spent together led them to re-examine their relationship , and why they broke up . When a judge arrived to post their bail , they were finally married in a civil ceremony with the sheriff as witness . They announced their marriage to their colleagues soon after . At the end of season five , they were planning to spend a year in Paris while Brennan and Booth were away , as neither of them wanted `` to break in a new forensic anthropologist and FBI liaison . '' \n After Brennan 's intern , Wendell Bray , gives Angela $45 to help save a baby pig , the two kiss and begin a relationship . Their relationship continued throughout part of Season 5 . After they had been dating for a few months , Angela took a pregnancy test which came up positive . This test is later revealed , by a second test that Dr. Saroyan had run , to be a false positive . When Wendell found out , he told her that he would have supported her in her choices because it was his duty . This caused Angela to realize that while Wendell is a good guy , he was not `` ( her ) guy '' and subsequently ended their relationship . The break - up was mutual and amicable . \n Upon their return from Paris , Angela discovers that they are expecting their first child . Angela tries to keep her pregnancy a secret from the Jeffersonian team . This is because Angela wants to wait until after the first trimester and Hodgins wants to reveal the pregnancy when the time is right . It is later revealed that if Angela and Hodgins had a daughter , they would name her Temperance , after Dr. Brennan ; but strictly as a middle name , because the name Temperance is `` awful '' . Angela 's father wanted to name their child `` Staccato Mamba '' ( this came to him in a song ) . However , the three of them finally agree on the names Katherine Temperance for a girl and Michael Vincent for a boy . In the episode `` The Blackout in the Blizzard '' Angela and Hodgins find out they are both carriers of Leber 's congenital amaurosis , giving their baby a 25 percent chance of blindness . This was a huge devastation for the couple , but in the end they reminded each other that they can handle anything together . Their son was born healthy and without a vision impairment . He was named Michael , as planned , Staccato , as Angela 's father wanted , and Vincent , after the late Vincent Nigel - Murray , the full name thus becoming Michael Staccato Vincent Hodgins , but is more commonly known as Michael Vincent . \n Angela contemplates leaving the Jeffersonian at one point , under the assumption that her work does not contribute to cases in a meaningful way . She was also unsure of her ability to handle the graphic violence she was exposed to regularly at the lab . However , Dr. Goodman , the director of the Jeffersonian , spoke of the vital importance of her work in adding an element of humanity to the victims , returning their identity . This line of reasoning persuades her to remain at the lab . \n Angela and Hodgins met when Angela was brought on to work at the Jeffersonian by Brennan . While initially on good terms , they grew closer throughout season one . At the beginning of season two , Hodgins became obviously interested in her , and pursued her more openly . After a few episodes of palpable sexual tension , Hodgins finally asked Angela on a date in the episode `` The Girl with the Curl '' . While their date was quite successful , Angela broke it off fearing repercussions if things went badly . Later , after Hodgins was rescued from being buried alive , they kissed , and at the end of the episode they went home together . Angela later asked Hodgins if she could sleep at his place one night after being spooked by restored video footage , and soon they were openly involved . After refusing Hodgins ' marriage proposal twice , she proposed to him . Their wedding was cut short in the season two finale when it was revealed that Angela was technically married to a man from Fiji , Grayson Barasa . Their relationship ended after a lengthy search for her husband , and issues regarding Jack 's trust of Angela .",

    "context": "Peppermint is a 2018 American vigilante action film directed by Pierre Morel and starring Jennifer Garner . Also featuring John Ortiz , John Gallagher Jr. , Juan Pablo Raba , and Tyson Ritter , the plot follows a mother who sets out for revenge against the cartel that killed her husband and daughter . The film was released in the United States on September 7 , 2018 . It has grossed over $46 million worldwide and received generally negative reviews from critics , although Garner 's performance was praised . \n Riley executes Judge Stevens by blowing up his house , having already killed the defense and prosecution lawyers involved , deaths which Inman , Carmichael and Beltran learn of after the explosion . They decide to tell the media about Riley , which causes a debate on social media between those who see her as a hero and those who see her as a criminal . \n Riley survives a trap set by Diego , follows his henchmen to Diego 's home , and kills many of his men . When Diego 's young daughter -- who evokes her own murdered child -- interrupts her as she confronts Diego , she hesitates and Diego wounds her and escapes . Inman calls Carmichael to Skid Row to wait for Riley . Carmichael , secretly on Diego 's payroll , arrives and shoots Inman dead , then notifies Diego of Riley 's likely destination . \n On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , the film holds an approval rating of 9 % based on 106 reviews , and an average rating of 3.4 / 10 . The website 's critical consensus reads , `` Far from refreshing , Peppermint wastes strong work from Jennifer Garner on a dreary vigilante revenge story that lacks unique twists or visceral thrills . '' On Metacritic , the film has a weighted average score of 29 out of 100 , based on 26 critics , indicating `` generally unfavorable reviews '' . Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of `` B + '' on an A+ to F scale . \n In the United States and Canada , Peppermint was released alongside The Nun and God Bless the Broken Road , and was projected to gross $10 -- 13 million from 2,980 theaters in its opening weekend . The film made $4.7 million on its first day , including $800,000 from Thursday night previews . It went on to debut to $13.4 million , finishing second at the box office , behind The Nun . \n Riley heads to a business that is a front for Diego 's money laundering , where she kills most of his men , save for one she interrogates . Diego realizes Riley is responsible for his recent shipments going missing and resolves to kill her . Meanwhile , Inman discovers Riley has been living on Skid Row , owing to recent changes to crime patterns in the area . She finds Riley 's van , which is filled with the stolen weapons , and learns that the people there see Riley as their guardian angel for keeping them safe . \n Riley returns to Skid Row , which is swarming with Diego 's men . She manages to kill several of them and finds Inman 's body . Using Inman 's phone , she contacts the media and reveals her location , inviting both the media and LAPD . She confronts Diego , stalling him long enough for the police to arrive . Diego shoots Carmichael and runs , only to be beaten down by Riley . Surrounded by police , Riley shoots Diego in the head yet manages to escape . \n Despite her injuries , Riley is able to positively identify the shooters . The detectives handling the case are hesitant to pursue charges against the three , as they are members of Garcia 's drug cartel , who wields considerable influence . Detective Beltran explains to his partner Carmichael that the last detective who tried to bring Garcia to justice was found murdered and his badge placed inside his own police station locker . \n Five years earlier , the same woman , Riley North , is working as a banker in Los Angeles struggling to make ends meet . Her husband Chris owns a failing mechanic shop . They have a ten - year - old daughter , Carly . Chris 's friend tries to talk him into robbing Diego Garcia , a powerful drug lord . Chris turns him down , but not before Garcia has already discovered his involvement and ordered his men to make an example of him . Riley and Chris take Carly out for pizza and to a carnival for her birthday since no one showed up to her party . At the carnival , Carly orders peppermint ice cream , hence the film 's title . As the family walks to the car , Diego 's men gun down her husband and daughter in a drive - by shooting . She is wounded but survives . \n The film was released in the United States on September 7 , 2018 . \n As of October 25 , 2018 , Peppermint has grossed $35.4 million in the United States and Canada , and $11.1 million in other territories , for a total worldwide gross of $46.5 million , against a production budget of $25 million . \n Prior to the preliminary hearing , Riley is visited by the perpetrators ' lawyer , who tries to bribe her . She refuses the bribe , but the lawyer notices she has anti-psychotic medication at home and uses this information to paint her as an unreliable witness . Judge Stevens , who is secretly on the cartel 's payroll , declares there is insufficient evidence to allow the perpetrators to stand trial and dismisses the case , while the prosecuting lawyers do nothing . Outraged , Riley tries to attack her family 's killers , but is tasered and placed on a psychiatric hold in a mental institution . En route , she escapes and vanishes . \n Five years later , Detectives Beltran and Carmichael arrive at the site of the carnival and find the three shooters hanging from a ferris wheel , having been executed by Riley . The executions attract the attention of FBI agent Lisa Inman , who meets with Beltran and Carmichael . Inman explains that before vanishing , Riley robbed the bank she used to work at , and that she has now returned , having robbed a gun store of various assault rifles and ammunition . \n Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun - Times gave the film 2 / 4 stars , writing `` In the stylishly directed but gratuitously nasty and cliché - riddled Peppermint , Garner plays essentially two characters cut from the same person . '' Writing for TheWrap , Todd Gilchrist said that Peppermint `` ultimately possesses the stale predictability of an unwrapped candy discovered at the bottom of a purse . '' \n Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter called the film `` Death Wish on steroids '' , and said it `` lacks subtlety and anything even remotely resembling credibility , but like its heroine , it certainly gets the job done '' . IndieWire 's Jude Dry gave the film a `` C + '' . He wrote that Garner deserves to be in better films , and said the film is `` rare return to form for Garner , who doles out her vigilante justice with effortless charm . Unfortunately , that 's about the only reason to see Peppermint '' . \n An unidentified woman is engaged in a brutal fight with a man in a car and finally dispatches him with a shot to the head . \n Beltran finds her critically wounded at her family 's gravestone and has her brought to the hospital , despite Riley 's expressed desire to die . Beltran later visits her , telling her that there are those who agree with what she did , and slips her the key to her handcuffs , allowing Riley to escape again .",

Pointillism is analogous to the four - color CMYK printing process used by some color printers and large presses that place dots of Cyan ( blue ) , Magenta ( red ) , Yellow , and Key ( black ) . Televisions and computer monitors use a similar technique to represent image colors using Red , Green , and Blue ( RGB ) colors . \n If red , blue , and green light ( the additive primaries ) are mixed , the result is something close to white light ( see Prism ( optics ) ) . Painting is inherently subtractive , but Pointillist colors often seem brighter than typical mixed subtractive colors . This may be partly because subtractive mixing of the pigments is avoided , and partly because some of the white canvas may be showing between the applied dots . \n Robert Delaunay , 1906 , Portrait de Metzinger , oil on canvas , 55 x 43 cm \n Pointillism also refers to a style of 20th - century music composition . Different musical notes are made in seclusion , rather than in a linear sequence , giving a sound texture similar to the painting version of Pointillism . This type of music is also known as punctualism or klangfarbenmelodie . \n Georges Lemmen , c. 1891 - 92 , The Beach at Heist , Musée d'Orsay Paris \n The painting technique used for Pointillist color mixing is at the expense of the traditional brushwork used to delineate texture . \n Camille Pissarro , 1888 , La Récolte des pommes , oil on canvas , 61 x 74 cm , Dallas Museum of Art \n The technique relies on the ability of the eye and mind of the viewer to blend the color spots into a fuller range of tones . It is related to Divisionism , a more technical variant of the method . Divisionism is concerned with color theory , whereas pointillism is more focused on the specific style of brushwork used to apply the paint . It is a technique with few serious practitioners today , and is notably seen in the works of Seurat , Signac and Cross . However , see also Andy Warhol 's early works , and Pop Art . \n Henri - Edmond Cross , 1903 - 04 , Regatta in Venice , oil on canvas , 73.7 x 92.7 cm , Museum of Fine Arts , Houston \n Hippolyte Petitjean , 1919 , Femmes au bain , oil on canvas , 61.1 X 46 cm , private collection \n Georges Seurat and Paul Signac developed the technique in 1886 , branching from Impressionism . The term `` Pointillism '' was coined by art critics in the late 1880s to ridicule the works of these artists , and is now used without its earlier mocking connotation . The movement Seurat began with this technique is known as Neo-impressionism . The Divisionists , too , used a similar technique of patterns to form images , though with larger cube - like brushstrokes . \n Paul Signac , 1901 , L'Hirondelle Steamer on the Seine , oil on canvas , National Gallery in Prague \n The majority of Pointillism is done in oil paint . Anything may be used in its place , but oils are preferred for their thickness and tendency not to run or bleed . \n Jean Metzinger , c. 1906 , Femme au Chapeau ( Woman with a Hat ) , oil on canvas , 44.8 x 36.8 cm , Korban Art Foundation",

    "context": "A reduction of available racing surface and salt thickness has led to the cancellation of events at Bonneville , such as Speed Week in 2014 and 2015 . Available racing surface is much reduced with just 2.5 miles ( 4.0 km ) available instead of the 9 - mile ( 14 km ) courses traditionally used for Speed Week . \n The annual Speed Week was cancelled in both 2014 and 2015 , as were many land - speed racing events , due to deteriorating track conditions . Heavy rains caused a layer of mud from surrounding mountains to flow onto the flats , covering approximately 6 mi ( 9.7 km ) of the track . Although another section of the flats would normally be used , nearby salt mining operations had reduced the size of the alternative track . \n The depth of the salt crust at Bonneville has also been decreasing , possibly leaching into a saltwater aquifer . Measured at as much at 3 ft ( 0.91 m ) in the 1940s and 50s , it has been reduced to just 0.17 ft ( 0.052 m ) in 2015 . \n The salt flats were first used for motor sports in 1912 , but did not become truly popular until the 1930s when Ab Jenkins and Sir Malcolm Campbell competed to set land speed records . \n Originally , the straightaway was marked with a broad black line down its center . This was eventually changed to lines down either side , as the center line wore out too quickly . As the costs for painting the lines has gone up , organizations have switched to flags and cones as track markers . The last event to use black lines was Speed Week , August 2009 . \n In October , the Southern California Timing Association puts on World Finals , a scaled - down version of Speed Week . \n In August , the Southern California Timing Association and Bonneville Nationals Inc. organize Speed Week , the largest meet of the year , which attracts several hundred drivers who compete to set highest speed in a range of categories . \n In September each year is the World of Speed , ( similar to Speed Week ) organized by the Utah Salt Flats Racing Association . The USFRA also meet on the first Wednesday of each month throughout the summer . \n Since at least the 1990s , track preparations have been the responsibility of the event organizers . Days or weeks in advance , the track preparers identify an area best suited for their track layouts and begin grading the tracks . Surveyors are brought in to survey the timing trap distances . A day before racing begins , the track markers are added . \n Numerous land speed records in various vehicle categories and classes have been set on the Bonneville speed way . In 1960 , Mickey Thompson became the first American to break the 400 mph ( 644 km / h ) barrier , hitting 406.60 mph ( 654.36 km / h ) and surpassing John Cobb 's 1947 one - way Land speed record of 403 mph ( 649 km / h ) . Other notable examples of Bonneville speed records include : \n Historically , the speedway was marked out by the Utah Department of Transportation at the start of each summer . Originally , two tracks were prepared ; a 10 - mile ( 16 km ) long straightaway for speed trials and an oval or circular track for distance runs , which was typically between 10 and 12 miles ( 16 and 19 km ) long depending on the condition of the salt surface . \n The number of tracks and the timed sections for each track are set according to what is most beneficial for each event . Large public meets such as Speed Week run as many as four tracks with several timed miles , usually starting with the second mile and running to the fifth mile . Smaller meets that typically only run world record attempts will utilize a single track , with one timed mile and one timed kilometer in the middle of the track . Additional marks and cones indicate the end of the track and the position of timing equipment . \n Though recent studies have been made ( since 1960 ) , the causes of this deterioration are not clear , although the evidence points toward both local climatic changes and salt mining . Some strategies were devised to revert the decreasing salt surface , such as pumping back salt , though this had no effect . \n In late August , the BUB Motorcycle Speed Trials are held . \n In the series finale episode of Mad Men , Donald Draper drives a 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS muscle car in the races at Bonneville Speedway . \n Bonneville Speedway is an area of the Bonneville Salt Flats near Wendover , Utah , that is marked out for motor sports . It is particularly noted as the venue for numerous land speed records . \n Coordinates : 40 ° 45 ′ 45 '' N 113 ° 53 ′ 44 '' W ﻿ / ﻿ 40.762522 ° N 113.895520 ° W ﻿ / 40.762522 ; - 113.895520 \n Each year , there are usually a few private meets that are not publicized scattered among the larger public meets .",
